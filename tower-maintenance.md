### Guidance notes and useful information

**How to get help from Stewardship & Management Workgroup**

  * [Terms of Engagement for Tower Visits](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ref-SM_ToE_2018-Ver-2.0.pdf) – this guidance note provides information on how to engage with the Stewardship & Management workgroup for advice on all aspects of bells, bell hanging, bell towers and bell maintenance.

**Maintenance**

  * [Belfry Maintenance](/product/manual-of-belfry-maintenance/) - For comprehensive information on Belfry Maintenance, the Central Council’s Manual of Belfry maintenance is available for purchase through the online shop.
  * <a href="https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SM_TowerAccess_2019_Ver_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tower Access</a> - No matter how comfortable and well equipped your ringing room or how excellent the go of the bells, if you can&apos;t reach them safely they&apos;re not much use to you. For that reason it is well worth considering the state of the access route to the tower.

**Major Projects**

  * Information and guidance notes to support major projects, including 
      * new installations,
      * restorations and
      * augmentations.
