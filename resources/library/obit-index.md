  This index contains references to obituaries published in <em>Bell News </em>and<em> The Ringing World </em>from <b>1881</b> to <b>2000</b>. Originally compiled by John Eisel and Chris Ridley with additional material from Alan Ellis, it is now maintained by the CCCBR Library Committee and contains<strong> [cccbr_sc_obit_count fetch=&#8221;refs&#8221;]</strong> references to<strong> [cccbr_sc_obit_count fetch=&#8221;names&#8221;]</strong> names.

Where a page reference is shown in **bold** it refers to an Obituary page rather than to another reference. Information on Place has yet to be completed for some people.

Plans are in hand to include obituaries from 2001 to the present.
