The work of the Library is funded largely by the generous support of the Friends of the Library scheme. Membership may be either Individual, or Corporate for Associations or Guilds. There is no fixed subscription, but a minimum of £5.00 per year is suggested for Individual Friends and £10.00 for Corporate Members. There is no upper limit! Life Membership is also available for a single subscription of at least £100.00. This support means that you are helping to preserve part of our ringing heritage, and you will receive an annual newsletter keeping you up to date with what is happening in the Library. The newsletter lists recent acquisitions and is accompanied by an original essay written especially for the Friends. They are usually of bibliographic interest. If you wish to join the Friends of the Library, please complete the form below: [gravityform id=2 title=false description=false ajax=true]
