Recruitment and retention of new ringers is challenging; there are no magic answers. What works well for some towers may not work for others - but there are plenty of positive examples out there to learn from. The [Volunteer and Leadership Workgroup](/about/workgroups/volunteer-and-leadership/) has developed an **interactive workshop** to help you create a plan for successful recruitment and retention, personalised to your own locality and requirements using the Association of Ringing Teachers’ **10-point action plan**. Successful recruitment and retention depends on the efficacy of each stage of the plan.

The [resources pack](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Recruitment-Retention-Resources-Pack.zip) has been developed for you to download and use, so that you can **run your own workshop**. The pack includes:

  * Presentation slides (PowerPoint and PDF) – these can be used with no editing, or adapted to suit your needs
  * Presention notes – to use alongside the slides
  * Organiser’s guide – to help you plan, advertise and run a successful event
  * Facilitators’ guide – including open questions to promote appropriate discussions
  * 10-point action plan template

Traditional ways of recruiting new ringers may no longer work. We are noticing a shift away from recruitment directly through the Church community and our own families, towards larger-scale recruitment events and general appeals for new ringers. The success of the Ringing Remembers campaign demonstrates what can be done on a much larger scale. This workshop can be used to develop new ideas for successful recruitment and retention.

The workshop was piloted in Shropshire and Sussex in 2019-20, and then run on the V&L/ART Day in March 2020. It is based on [recruitment and retention resources compiled by ART](http://ringingteachers.org/resource-centre/recruitment-and-retention) (Association of Ringing Teachers), particlularly the “Recruitment Toolbox”.
