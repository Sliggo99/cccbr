            Whilst many Societies already have defined officers, constitutions and Safeguarding policies the Central Council is aware that some societies may need some support creating these documents.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A Society wishing to register with the Central Council is recommended to review the roles, constitutions and Safeguarding policies in place with established Affiliated Societies and use these as a template for their own society. Further information can be found with regards to Safeguarding policies by contacting&nbsp;<a href="mailto:safeguarding@cccbr.tunbury.org">safeguarding@cccbr.tunbury.org</a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A list of Affiliated Societies can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="/about/affiliated-societies/">/about/affiliated-societies/</a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Council is looking to create a library of useful tools and templates for existing small societies or those wishing to set up a new ringing society.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            If your society has a constitution, a supporting policy or any other documents or information which you think might be useful for other small societies please let us know by contacting Edward Sterland, the Council’s Co-ordinator for Small Societies at <a href="mailto:SmallSocieties@/">SmallSocieties@cccbr.tunbury.org</a>
