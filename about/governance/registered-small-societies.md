          <p>
            At the Central Council AGM on 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;September 2020 the Council voted to approve a change to its rules which introduces a new level of Central Council society membership.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Registered Small Society is a new level of membership open to ringing societies with 75 or fewer members.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            What are the benefits?
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            <em>To your society</em>:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Affiliation to the Central Council as the national and international body for ringers recognised by the Church of England and other organisations can help raise the profile of your society.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strengthen your connections to other guilds both locally and nationally.•Makes it easier to access services and support available from the Council, especially when working with the Church of England.
            </li>
            <li>
              Have an influence into the Central&nbsp;Council as it is moving towards being a proactive support group for all ringers, potentially providing opportunities that members of the society might benefit from in future.
            </li>
            <li>
              Develop best practices (eg.&nbsp;safeguarding)
            </li>
            <li>
              For higher education societies, closer links with the Council’s new Workgroup on Universities & Colleges.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            <em>To the wider ringing community:</em>
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              A better-connected Council is more able to serve the interests of the ringing community.
            </li>
            <li>
              A more diverse membership will contribute to the quality of the Council’s strategic planning.
            </li>
            <li>
              A greater role for small societies, contributes to the Council’s aim to promote the recruitment, training and retention of young ringers, including through university societies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Higher standards and closer links between all societies can only serve to enhance the reputation of ringing and serve the interests of all ringing societies.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Church of England values the Council’s role in promoting a network of strong, interconnected societies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bringing small societies into the organisational family of ringing makes ringing stronger in the eyes of the Church and the other external bodies on whose support it depends.
            </li>
          </ul>
