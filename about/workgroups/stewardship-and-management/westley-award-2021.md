            <strong>Background</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Chairman of Westley Group, Tom Westley, has again kindly agreed to sponsor the Westley Award for Church Bell Maintenance and Improvement. The first Westley Award was made to Barry Garrett of Carlisle Cathedral in 2019, and the second award to Sue McClaughry of Calstock in 2020.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For 2021, we are retaining the overall aim of recognising the recruitment, training and development of skills of people new to belfry maintenance and improvement. For 2021, we are expanding the criteria as many such activities have been limited during most of 2020 and into 2021. The awards will be presented in September 2021 at the CCCBR AGM.
          </p>

            The award will be made to a person who has engaged in supporting maintenance and improvement of tower bell installations for the first time in the last 5 years, and shows the most commitment to developing and using their own skills, and developing such skills of others. Activities may be in towers and elsewhere, for example advice, videos, demonstrations, preparation and presentation of training materials, etc.
