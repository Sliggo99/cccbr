**Background**

The Chairman of Westley Group, Tom Westley, has again kindly agreed to sponsor the Westley Award for Church Bell Maintenance.  The first Westley Award was made to Barry Garrett of Carlisle Cathedral, at the CCCBR conference held in London in September 2019.

Westley Group have now cast several single bells and, during 2019, cast their first complete ring of 8 bells for Lindfield, Sussex.  Tom is a metallurgist and engineer, but not a ringer, and keen to see the development of engineering skills, particularly amongst younger people. The award this year again links these interests.

**Who can get involved?**

The award will be made to a person who has become involved in the maintenance of tower bell installations (used for English style change ringing) for the first time in the last 5 years, and shows the most commitment to developing and using their own skills and those of others. Applicants in 2019 are free to enter again in 2020. People who are or have been employed by a professional bell foundry, bell hanger or similar organisation are NOT eligible for an award.  The awards will be made in September 2020 at the CCCBR annual conference in Nottingham. The judges will include members of the CCCBR Stewardship & Management Workgroup and an independent  
member.

**Call for nominations**

Female nominees and younger people are particularly encouraged to apply! The closing date for nominations will be noon 31st May 2020. Applications, on the form provided, will be reviewed during June and the winner announced in July.  Nominations may be made for yourself or for someone else.

**The prizes**

Westley Group will award the winner £100 and a certificate.  The judges may also commend other applicants and present a certificate to them.

**Judging criteria**

  * Benefits of the work undertaken by the nominee in maintenance and installation projects
  * Nominees’ approach to learning about tower bell maintenance
  * Nominees’ support for others not previously involved in maintenance work
  * Summary of scale and scope of projects undertaken in the last 5 years (the number and cost of projects are not primary criteria)

(The judges’ decisions will be final)

**Application Form**

Please return to the Workgroup Lead (smlead@cccbr.tunbury.org) by noon on Sunday 31st May 2020.  <a href="https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SM_WestleyAward_2020_Ver_1-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The application form can be downloaded here.</a>
