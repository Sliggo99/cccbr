            Our purpose is to establish contact and build relationships with people who will influence bellringing and its future.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Covid pandemic has focussed everyone’s minds on how bellringing will be affected in the short and long term.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            There are four main stakeholder groups in the UK: The Church of England, national and local Government, the amenity groups, and major funders.&nbsp; Contact has been established with the Church of Wales and the Church of Scotland on Covid-related matters.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Please get in touch with us if you have any ideas or contacts who can help.
          </p>

            Since the outbreak of Covid and the national cessation of ringing, we have established a positive working relationship with the Church of England’s Covid Recovery Team. Our conversations have resulted in national guidance for ringing in the UK during the pandemic. This work is done by Mark Regan, Simon Linford, Phillip Barnes, and David Pouncey.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We have established an open and continuing dialogue with the Church of England, the Church Buildings Council, Historic England, the Churches Conservation Trust, the Victorian Society, and the Arts’ Council.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Other groups will be contacted in 2021 including major funders such as the National Heritage Lottery Fund, and major Trusts and Charities.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Discussion topics include: the effect of Covid on bellringing, Diocesan reorganisations, church closures, the selling of bells, the role of volunteers in the Church of England, working with the amenity groups and the Churches Conservation Trust.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Covid has affected our plans and any meaningful dialogue with the Government is understandably difficult. However, the stakeholders contacted so far want to work closely with our ringing community to keep our churches open and used.
