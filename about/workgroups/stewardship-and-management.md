Stewardship & Management Workgroup Report, First published in the Central Council Annual Meeting Papers 2019

SM WG Annual Report for 2018
SM WG Annual Report for 2019

1. Making the activities of the Workgroup better known  
[https://cccbr.org.uk/about/workgroups/stewardship-and-management/](https://cccbr.org.uk/about/workgroups/stewardship-and-management/) The Workgroup offers a wide range of advice and guidance to ringers, churches and local communities (as indicated on the webpage under the "What we do" link). In particular, we are looking for people with skills and experience to assist with our activities through use of:
  * social media
  * short videos etc to accompany advice and guidance and....
  * organisation of seminars and events
2. Financial matters  
This will include keeping guidance up to date and providing occasional advice in response to specific enquiries. Experience in any of the following areas would be useful:
  * Accounts (particularly of charities and non-companies)
  * VAT (particularly the listed places of worship scheme)
  * Gift aid
  * Fund raising for bell installation and restoration projects
3. Installation and maintenance projects  
This will include providing advice to ringers, churches and other stakeholders involved in bell installation and restoration projects. Experience in any of the following areas would be useful:
  * Bid writing
  * Project leadership and management
  * Community engagement
  * Stakeholder liaison
  * Church law, Church of England, faculties etc
  * Previous experience of bell installation / restoration projects(Note that engineering / technical skills may be helpful but are certainly not essential)
4. Tower and belfry inspections, installations and maintenance  
The Workgroup offers to inspect, provide advice and written reports on bell installations- and maintenance for parishes, towers, guilds / associations / diocese and other interested parties.  We now need additional people to provide such advice. These people may choose to be full members of the Workgroup but alternatively, may opt to join a new network of "specialists" able to assist with these "hands on" activities in a specific geographical area. Current membership is such that we have no people based in Wales, Scotland or Ireland, no one west of Somerset, north of Nottingham or east of a line roughly through Portsmouth, Oxford and Nottingham. We are therefore looking for people particularly in these areas, and who will be willing to visit towers to work with local ringers, diocese / guilds / associations etc. Experience would probably come from:
  * a similar role in their local guild / association area
  * an interest in engineering and mechanics

If you are interested in such activities but do not have appropriate experience, then contact us and we will consider how you may be able to gain relevant skills. Those willing to join the Workgroup (or offer specialist advice on any of our activities on an occasional basis) should contact the Workgroup Leader -- Alison Hodge ([SMLead@CCCBR.org.uk](mailto:SMLead@CCCBR.org.uk))
