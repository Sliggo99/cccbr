The Central Council has devoted some seed funding to this year’s first Mini-roadshow and have kept costs at reasonable levels, so that the registration fee is as low as possible.

There is a registration fee of £12 per adult, but no charge for those under the age of 18 on 8th September.

In either case, please ensure that you register in advance using the link below.
