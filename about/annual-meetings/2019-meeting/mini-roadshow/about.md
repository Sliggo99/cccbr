### Welcome to the London 2019 Mini-Roadshow

Organised for all ringers by the Central Council of Church Bellringers, London 2019 brings together everything you need for your ringing, now and in the future **for one day** at Goldsmiths College, London SE14 6NW on Sunday 8th September.

The success of the Ringing Roadshow at Newbury in 2014, which attracted over 2,000 ringers led to a suggestion of a regular annual event bringing ringing organisations, trade suppliers and ringers together inbetween major Roadshow festivals. The Central Council have devoted some seed funding to this year’s first mini-roadshow and if successful it will be used as a model for future events, held at the same location as the Council’s annual meeting.
