**<font color="#1f497d">John Taylor & Co.</font> continues a line of bell founding which has been unbroken since the middle of the 14th Century. In 1839 it moved to its present position in Loughborough, and is now proud to operate the largest bell foundry in the world. Centuries of experience, together with up to the minute advances in technology, has put Taylors at the forefront in the design and manufacture of bells, their fittings and frameworks.**

**Westley Group** **grew out of the Westley family business (seventh generation), established for more than 200 years, originally supplying mainly copper based alloy castings.  Following the closure of the Whitechapel Bell foundry, Tom Westley wanted to find a way to continue the Whitechapel tradition of casting church bells in the United Kingdom and has transferred a lot of Whitechapel’s equipment, skills and knowledge to the Group’s specialist sand casting bronze foundry near Stoke-on-Trent.**

**<font color="#1f497d">Bells of Whitechapel</font> offer a range of Whitechapel musical handbells, cup bells, ships bells, handled bells, clock bells and a selection of gift and presentation bells which can be personalised.  Whitechapel handbells have been manufactured since the 1740’s and continue to be made in south London, using original patterns and designs.**
