The 124th Annual meeting of the Central Council will once again be a virtual one.

As last year, a key element of our preparation will be to ensure that business is limited to what is essential and that any concerns or issues raised by Council Members are addressed in advance, as both debate and voting will be more difficult that in a normal setting.

The AGM of The Ringing World will also be part of the virtual meeting just as it was last year.

The meeting papers will be posted below as they become available.
