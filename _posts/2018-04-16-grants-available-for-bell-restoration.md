The Central Council Bell Restoration Fund is very grateful to have received a legacy from the estate of the late Norman Johnson, who was a member of this Committee for many years

We invite applications for grants or loans from the Fund; grants will not be paid until the work is completed and any grant offered will lapse if not claimed within two years.

Application forms may be obtained from the undersigned. The closing date for applications will be 18th May 2018.
