The Executive of the Central Council would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Will Bosworth on his appointment as Editor of the Ringing World, a significant role for the ringing community. We look forward to continuing to work with the RW Chair, Board Members and  
with the staff team under the leadership of its new editor. We would also like to thank Robert Lewis for his many years as Editor and wish him a long and healthy retirement.

We are entering a new phase for the global ringing community. The Central Council is taking a new direction, encouraging wider participation by ringers everywhere, developing the new Central Council weekend format and working on creating a vibrant community â€“ our mission to promote an environment where ringing can flourish. We therefore embrace building working relationships with key organisations and are together a band of ringers who care enough about the future to make a difference in shaping the future of ringing.
