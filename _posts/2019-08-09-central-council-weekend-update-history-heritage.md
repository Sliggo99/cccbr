Doug Hird and members of the Historical & Archive Workgroup will be considering various ways in which computer technology can be used to help historical researchers and the casual enquirer. With technology being widely available to all, there is an opportunity for ringers to record, share and learn.

Alan Regin will tell the story of 1,400 Ringing Remembers biographies and the challenges of getting from a list of Name / Tower / Association to a much broader story of the brave men who made the supreme sacrifice during the Great War.

Steve Coleman will deliver a keynote session on “When ringing had to stop”.  The astonishing, exciting and highly entertaining story of ringing during the Second World War.  Based on his painstaking research of the National Archives – together with the letters, diaries and newspapers of the time. Steve will be bringing this fascinating and long-untold story to life – with the aid of six first class readers, Mary Bone, Mike Trimm, Kath Johnson, Mike Winterbourne, Emma Rouse and Fred Bone.
