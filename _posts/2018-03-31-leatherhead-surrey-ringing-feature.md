  Good long article in county newspaper - hopefully attracting more new ringers!

Journalist a bit mixed up re Ringing Remembers and Battle’s Over celebrations - remember they are not mutually exclusive!  Sign up your new ringers with Ringing Remembers and plan for them to ring on Armistice Day (likely to be special ringing in the afternoon, time still tba) and you can also decide to be a tower ringing at 7.05pm as part of Battle’s Over - link in the article.
