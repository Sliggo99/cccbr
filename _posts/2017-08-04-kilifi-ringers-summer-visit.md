Some of the ringers from St Thomas&apos;, Kilifi, Kenya, have been in the UK on a ringing visit.  John and Deborah, recently married, and David (Tower Captain) are pictured here at All Saint&apos;s, Maidstone, where they joined the practice Aug 3rd with Pat Phipps who was hosting them.

Rod Lebon and Karen brought over 4 of the ringers in 2015, and this 2017 visit is David&apos;s first time.  The three have been ringing in Derbyshire, Oxford and Cambridge.  The focus of their tour was the Whiting Society summer school.  Lovely to have the Kilifi ringers here - Kilifi must be one of the more isolated towers in the world!
