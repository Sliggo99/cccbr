Blue Peter was filming at the RWNYC (Ringing World National Youth Contest) in July, with their presenter Lindsey Russell having ‘learnt the ropes’ the week before with Tom Hinks and the teams from KCACR and SCACR, - with Dickon Love sorting logistics, and additional involvement on the day of the competition from the Derbyshire young ringers team.  We have been advised that the feature (which includes a few surprises perhaps!) will be aired Thurs Sept 20th at 17:30 on the CBBC channel.

Please get this message out to everyone you know!  This will definitely be inspiring for potential new young (and old!) ringers.  Tell them this is what they can try too, and encourage them to sign up to Ringing Remembers <a href="https://a100./register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>

The programme airs a few times in the week and is available for replay for a month after.  If the date changes for any reason we will be informed in advance and will let you know.
