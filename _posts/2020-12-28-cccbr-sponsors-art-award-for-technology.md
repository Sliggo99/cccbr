I am pleased to announce that the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers has decided to co-sponsor the 2021 ART Award for Excellence in the Development of Technology, alongside John Taylor & Co. The total prize money for this award is now Â£1000 with the judges having the discretion to allocate the award money amongst one or more winners as they deem fit.

This year the technological and creative talents of so many ringers have led to the development of new and exciting tools, which in these difficult times have allowed us to keep on ringing, and keep bands together and motivated. In these circumstances, the expansion of the prize pot and ability to recognise more than one winner seems both a good and right thing to do.

It is not too late to make nominations for the ART Awards. You do not have to wait for someone else to nominate you or your group as you can do it yourself. Full details of the Awards can be found <a href="http://ringingteachers.org/recognition/awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The deadline for nominations is 31st December.
