Today we have published guidance for ringing in Wales from 3 May, when Wales goes to Alert Level 3. This guidance was developed from the England guidance and agreed with the Church in Wales by Matthew Turner, Master of the Llandaff & Monmouth Diocesan Association.

As with the England guidance published last week this guidance should be read in conjunction with the recently update guidance note about individual risks.
