Just as last year, the Annual Meeting in Edinburgh will be streamed live to allow anyone interested to see what&apos;s going on.  The live stream can either be viewed [here on the Central Council website](/about/meetings/2017-meeting/) or directly at YouTube <a href="http://bit.ly/cccbr-live-broadcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.  It is hoped that the open meetings on Sunday as well as the main meeting on Monday will be streamed, but this depends on the availability of network connectivity.
