The ART Conference is our leading national event and is open to anyone with an interest in ringing teaching and leadership. We would like to invite you to join us at Royston, Hertfordshire on 3/4 March 2018 for what is sure to be a full and interesting programme.

ART’s exciting agenda this year includes a great line up of speakers, with keynotes by the St Martin’s Guild Ringing Master, Simon Linford, Matt Bulbeck a professional outdoor sports coach and bell ringing teacher, and Colin Parker, ringer, teacher and keen cricketer.

Reflecting the rapid proliferation of questions and concerns around recent events, new additions to the ART line-up include presentations about safeguarding, insurance and risk assessments. There will also be an opportunity to talk through any local issues with the experts will be available throughout the day.

Finally helping you put a positive spin on all this we have some lively “how to” PR sessions from the Central Council’s Caroline Stockmann and Kate Flavell.

The second day of the conference weekend concentrates on simulators and new technology and is hosted by the Central Council. Get up to speed on the latest hardware and software developments, find out how to use simulators to improve the learning experience and take the opportunity to try out the newest ideas for teaching using simulators on different systems. Sessions are tailored to new, occasional and more frequent users and a third of the time will be practical.

The ART Conference is our leading national event and is open to anyone with an interest in ringing teaching and leadership. The ART Awards Ceremony on the evening of the 3rd will be accompanied by drinks and nibbles.
