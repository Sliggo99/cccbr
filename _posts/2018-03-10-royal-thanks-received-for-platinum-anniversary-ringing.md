The Central Council is pleased to have received a letter of thanks from Buckingham Palace for our efforts in celebrating the platinum anniversary of the royal couple&apos;s wedding last year.

The Public Relations committee collated all the details of the 345 ringing performances that were recorded in honour of the HM The Queen and HRH Prince Phillip&apos;s platinum wedding anniversary and sent it to Her Majesty as a record of the event.

Thank you to all ringers who took part in the performances.
