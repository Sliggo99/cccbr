We have started to receive queries about bells being rung on 31st January to mark the UK leaving the European Union.

There are historical moments for which bells have been rung - end of world wars for example. In 2018 the Central Council worked with the government on a recruitment and awareness campaign to recognise 100 years since WW1 Armistice.

However the Central Council, as a principle, does not endorse bell ringing for political reasons. Individual towers have discretion to ring for such occasions but is on a case by case basis and typically needs permission from the incumbent.
