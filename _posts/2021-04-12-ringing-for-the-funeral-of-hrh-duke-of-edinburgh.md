What the Church is expecting is tolling of a single bell during the hour before the funeral, which starts with a minute&apos;s silence at 3pm on Saturday. You donâ€™t need to toll for the full hour, just <u>during</u> the hour, e.g. up to 3pm. Half muffled preferred, but a single bell tolling slowly whether half muffled, fully muffled, or even unmuffled, will have the desired effect.
