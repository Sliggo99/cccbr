## National Lottery Grants for Heritage - an outline

This outline is intended only to give a flavour of the grants programme. Authoritative details will be found at:

<https://www.hrballiance.org.uk/resources/funding/>.

## Purpose

Grants are to support the heritage sector to strengthen its recovery from the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the medium term and to build back for positive change across the UK’s heritage. The scheme supports a broad range of heritage projects and activities.

This will mark a return to NLHF’s core business, but it is not a return to “business as usual”.

## Size of grants

Three levels of grants are available:

  * from £3,000 to £10,000
  * from £10,000 to £250,000
  * from £250,000 to £5 million

## What expenditure is eligible

### Outcomes

During 2021-22, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, **priority will be given** to at least one or more of the following outcomes:

  * A wider range of people will be involved in heritage&apos; (mandatory outcome)
  * The funded organisation will be more resilient
  * People will have greater wellbeing
  * People will have developed skills
  * The local area will be a better place to live, work or visit
  * The local economy will be boosted

The other three outcomes are:

  * Heritage will be in better condition.
  * Heritage will be identified and better explained.
  * People will have learnt about heritage, leading to change in ideas and actions.

All projects are to demonstrate that they are building long-term environmental sustainability into their plans, as appropriate

### The three priorities for heritage remain:

  * Landscape and nature.
  * Community heritage.
  * Heritage at risk.

### Types of activity

The funding can support a broad range of types of activity and cover a wide range of direct project costs. As an example, projects could include:

  * Volunteer expenses
  * Training costs
  * Event costs (including room hire, refreshments and equipment)
  * Capital works
  * Repair and maintenance (revenue)
  * New staff posts
  * Professional fees (for example, legal costs)
  * Paid training placements
  * Costs to improve access to heritage
  * Activities to help strengthen the organisation
  * Costs associated with taking on new responsibility for heritage (for example, feasibility studies)
  * Full Cost Recovery
  * Digital outputs
  * Repair and conservation
