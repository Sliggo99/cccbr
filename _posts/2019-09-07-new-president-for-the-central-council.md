During the 2019 Annual Meeting today, Simon Linford became the new President following outgoing President Christopher O&apos;Mahony&apos;s decision to stand down to move back home to Australia.  Simon has a wealth of experience when it comes to ringing at all levels, being well known for his involvement in the St. Martin&apos;s Guild and the Birmingham School of Bell Ringers.

Our thanks go to Christopher for all his hard work and dedication during his time in office, and wish him well with his future endeavours back home in Oz.  Welcome Simon!
