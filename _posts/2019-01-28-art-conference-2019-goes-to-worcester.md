Reflecting the rapid proliferation of questions and concerns around recent events, additions to the ART line-up include presentations from the Church of England about safeguarding and Ecclesiastical Insurance about bell ringing insurance and risk assessments. There will be opportunities to talk through any local issues with the experts who will be available throughout the day.

The second day of the conference weekend concentrates on building a vision for the future of youth ringing and is hosted by the Central Council. A day of speakers and break-out sessions. A day for you to help shape the future. A day for anyone interested in developing the leaders and ringers of the future.

  * Successful Leaders and the D of E Scheme – Christopher O’Mahony
  * Parental Involvement: What can we learn from other Activities – Pip Penney

The day will include a number of break-out sessions led by youth leaders. These will provide plenty of opportunities to share ideas and good practice and give you the chance to draw a vision of the future and start working towards it.

The ART Conference is our leading national event and is open to anyone with an interest in ringing teaching and leadership. Join us at Worcester on 2/3 March 2019 for what is sure to be a full and interesting weekend.
