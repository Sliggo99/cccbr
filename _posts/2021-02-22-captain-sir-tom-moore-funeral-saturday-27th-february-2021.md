Many bellringers are planning to toll a single bell 100 times this coming Saturday to mark the funeral of Captain Sir Tom Moore. The exact time of the funeral has not been released so as to reduce the risk of well wishers gathering. For those wanting to give a consistent voice from bell towers we suggest 12 noon as a time to ring. We will be sending out a media release to say this is happening so that the significance of a bell ringing is not lost on those hearing it.

As always, any ringing should be with the permission of the incumbent, someone else should know that you are visiting a bell tower to ring on your own, or take a family member with you.

There is an event on Bellboard should you wish to link performances for publication in the Ringing World <https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/event.php?id=13536>
