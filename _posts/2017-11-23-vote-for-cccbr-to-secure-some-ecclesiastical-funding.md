Ecclesiastical are running a scheme where charities can ‘win’ £1000. As we have worked with them recently to promote their communities project we had hoped they would automatically give us some funding but seems there is another route&#8230;

All that people need to do is complete the nomination form (link below), quoting our name &#8220;Central Council of Church Bell Ringers&#8221; and our registered charity number 270036. Takes a minute or so. Deadline Dec 5th.

Then we have a chance of winning £1000. This can be used for a variety of our activities including attracting more ringers.
