‘Face to Face’ (the official newsletter of the Salisbury Diocesan Guild of Ringers) will be used in this week’s recording of our brand-new series of Have I Got News for You, broadcast on BBC One at **9:00pm on Friday 14<sup>th</sup> May 2021**. The programme will then be available on the BBC iPlayer on demand service for 30 days. The guest host this week will be Romesh Ranganathan and joining team captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton will be comedian Jo Brand and author Lemn Sissay.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the recording, the publication might not make it into the final edit of the programme. This is due to the original record lasting approximately two hours but the final cut lasting just under thirty minutes. That said, the programme is very hopeful that the newsletter will be featured in the main show, and at the very least in the extended show, &#8216;Have I Got A Bit More News for You&apos;, which is broadcast late on Monday evening (22:00 BBC Two).
