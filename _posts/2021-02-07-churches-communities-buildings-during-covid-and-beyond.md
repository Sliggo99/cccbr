The University of York are conducting a survey on behalf of Church of England, Historic England, the Association of English Cathedrals, the National Churches Trust and the Historic Religious Buildings Alliance for you to contribute to thinking and planning at a key moment in the developing response to COVID-19. The aim is to draw together the experience and insights of clergy and other church staff, volunteers, congregations, and members of the wider community.

<https://churchesandcovid.org>

#### As church volunteers, the Bellringing community can contribute greatly to this survey by giving details on your needs in the belfry after lockdown restrictions are lifted, If restrictions are ongoing, are there more things churches/cathedrals could do to help you (and others) stay connected? What would you miss most if your church/cathedral was forced to close permanently?

The survey only takes a few minutes to complete, but even if we could get at least 1,000 ringers to complete it, it would have a significant sway in informing and educating church and heritage organisations to the contribution that bellringers make.

Please share this with your distribution lists and encourage as many as possible to respond.

Thank you.
