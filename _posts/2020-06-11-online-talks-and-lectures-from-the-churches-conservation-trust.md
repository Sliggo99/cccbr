The Churches Conservation Trust is running a series of online talks and lectures exploring different topics connected to the churches in their care.  For a full list of lectures visit their site at <https://www.visitchurches.org.uk/what-we-do/things-to-do-at-home/online-talks-and-lectures.html>

However, I would draw your attention to a specific talk on Thursday 16th July at 1pm - The Ringing Isle: An introduction to bells in Britain given by Gareth Davies, a member of the Central Council’s Historical & Archive Workgroup, described as “_An introductory canter across the centuries, exploring aspects of church bells and bellringing? How did Britain come to have ‘bells so many and so tuneable’ (Thomas Fuller, 1640)? What purposes did they serve? What powers were they believed to have? And how are they faring today?”_

To sign up and get a reminder for the lecture visit the Facebook events page at <https://www.facebook.com/events/396069534644136/>
