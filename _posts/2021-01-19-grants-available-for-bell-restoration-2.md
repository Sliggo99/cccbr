The Central Council Bell Restoration Fund is very grateful to have received a legacy from the estate of the late John Barnes, who was a member of the former Bell Restoration Committee for many years.

We invite applications for grants from the Fund; grants will not be paid until the work is completed and any grant offered will lapse if not claimed within three years.

Details of the allocation criteria and an application form are available from me. The closing date for applications will be 28th February 2021.
