The May 12th issue of The Ringing World contains extensive material on matters of current importance to ringers: the proposed reforms of the Central Council, the long-running York Minster saga and a recruitment initiative in schools, all covered in a depth which other media find hard to manage. There is much more besides.

The Ringing World have been working to improve the content, so if you haven’t read a copy recently, <a href="http://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/issues/5533.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take a look at this issue which we are making available free online</a>.
