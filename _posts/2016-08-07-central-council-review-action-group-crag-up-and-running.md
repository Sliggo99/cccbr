Following the Council&apos;s overwhelming acceptance of the proposal to set up a group to review the Council&apos;s purpose, structure and function in May, sufficient volunteers have now come forward to form the group.  Members are keen to get on with their tasks and have been enthusiastically discussing how to go about them.

As agreed in the motion, the group is equally divided between non-members, ex-members and current members.  They are:

**Non-Members:**

Alison Everett, Sussex  
Andrew Howard, Bath & Wells  
Gemma McGee, New Ringer (Great Malvern Priory)  
Tony McIlwrick, Scottish Association  
Pat Wheeler, Southall and Nottingham DG

**Ex-members:**

Phillip Barnes, Kent CA  
Peter S Bennett, Llandaff and Monmouth DA  
Roger Booth, London County  
Simon Meyer, ASCY  
Robert Wellen, Salisbury

**Current Members:**

Tony Furnivall, North American Guild  
David Smith, ANZAB  
Duncan Walker, Carlisle DG  
Clyde Whittaker, Middlesex  
Stefan Zientek, Chester DG

Significantly more people volunteered than required and I would like to thank everyone who offered to help.

One of the Group&apos;s most early tasks will be to consult all ringers across the Globe to find out what they would like the Council to do for them and for ringing.  Please look out for further announcements about how you can contribute to the review process.
