Nigel Huddleston MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary at DCMS, announced on 24th February 2021, that â€˜the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme will be renewed this year on the same terms as it operated previously. This scheme will continue to benefit listed places of worship across the country during these difficult times. It will also help to ensure that they are able to reopen fully once it is safe to do so.
