The two-page feature on Julie and the amazing bell ringing campaign to save lives, in which many of you have been involved, and which has raised over £7m to date, is due to appear in The Telegraph tomorrow (Friday 17th February). The press release, with which we approached the National press in the first instance, is available on the [Press Releases](/press-releases/) page.
