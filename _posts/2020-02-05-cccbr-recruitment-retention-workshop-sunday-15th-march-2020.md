  <strong><em>“Church bell ringing faces recruitment crisis”</em></strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Sound familiar?  Recruitment and retention of new ringers is challenging but there plenty of positive examples out there to learn from.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Matt Lawrence of Lilleshall in Shropshire recently ran a workshop about recruitment as a set of three discussion sessions. The workshop assumes that you should not just &#8220;do recruiting&#8221; without a plan. It can be run in as a stand-alone event in an association or branch.  It is designed to help leaders, teachers and recruiters reflect on and (re-)write their recruitment plan.  Important dimensions are discussion, and the presence of recent recruits who can comment on their experience.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Day 2 of the ART Conference in March, based at Hilton in Derbyshire, is run by the CCCBR’s Volunteering & Leadership Workgroup who will be running the workshop, alongside other guest speakers, so that you leave with a simple 10 point plan on how to recruit and follow up by keeping new ringers interested.
