1 – 18 November 2018

This (<a href="https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/event.php?id=9128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/event.php?id=9128</a>)  is the official BellBoard event for all ringing on and around the centenary of the World War One Armistice, on 11th November 1918.

Please add your planned attempts and then link your completed performances of any length: tolling, touches, quarter peals or peals. You may wish to link performances to other events as well, for instance if there is also a local project to mark the occasion. (It is at the Ringing World’s discretion how these will be printed.)

_Ringing Remembers_ is the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers’ campaign to mark the Armistice Centenary, officially endorsed and sponsored by HM Government. It encourages **muffled or half-muffled ringing for the 11am Act of Remembrance followed by open ringing at 12:30pm on Sunday, 11th November** – aligning with the published agenda for processions and marches in celebration of peace. Nevertheless, knowing the national mood to acknowledge this centenary, CCCBR encourages all ringers to respond as they see fit, taking into account the wide variety of local circumstances. Ringing open at or around 12:30pm is the ideal and recommended option, but any time that afternoon/evening is also supported.

_Ringing Remembers_ is also focusing on recruiting 1,400 new ringers to ring for the Armistice Centenary, in honour of the 1,400 known to have been lost in the war. There is a database of new _Ringing Remembers_ learners at <a href="https://a100.cccbr.tunbury.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a100.cccbr.tunbury.org</a> – please make sure you register yourself, or tell your new ringers to do so.

Performances will be collated and printed in the Ringing World soon after the 11th November, so please remember to link your performance to this event as soon as possible.

The Ringing World is also looking for special photographs to mark the occasion in its published coverage. You can link photographs to performances, submit them independently via the ‘Add Photos’ link on the left panel, or email [frontpage@ringingworld.co.uk.](mailto:frontpage@ringingworld.co.uk)

Associated performances will be held to be printed together. People should ensure that performances are linked to this **before** sending them for print.

The submitter has indicated that he or she will send this for print when all the expected performances have been added.
