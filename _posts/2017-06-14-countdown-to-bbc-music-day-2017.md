The third BBC Music Day takes place on Thursday 15th June with a theme of  “The Power of Music” – how it can bring us together, make us feel fantastic and create unforgettable memories

This year, ringing is again making its presence felt and appears as Number 2 in the BBC’s listing of its Top 10 Music Day Events.

**Ringing Events to listen out for or take part in**

_Global Ringing Event_

  * Bands from around the world are ringing at 7pm local time in support of BBC Music Day. So far more than 220 UK towers have registered with the BBC to ring at 7pm on Thursday 15th June, and their numbers have been swelled by over 30 more overseas towers, including Zimbabwe, Kenya, Australia, New Zealand, the US and Bermuda.

Knowing that Church bells are a wonderful symbol of community cohesion,  and since Music Day is all about uniting people through music, the BBC hope that the sound of bells will provide a memorable moment.

For an updated list of towers taking part, see the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4pkF2Q18rTm8XSq97PF26mY/bell-ringers-unite-for-bbc-music-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC Music Day</a> website. _ _
