[The Mathematics of Bell Ringing](https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/maths-bellringing)

Professor Sarah Hart, Gresham Professor of Geometry

Tuesday 5 Jan 2021, 1pm-2pm (online, or watch later)

<https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/maths-bellringing>

This lecture will look at change ringing, which is ringing a series of tuned bells in a particular sequence, and this has exciting mathematical properties.

We will also ask: why are bells bell-shaped? What properties of this shape create the sound of a bell, and by what amount should we scale the size of a bell to produce changes in pitch?
