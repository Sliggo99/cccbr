    The Covid guidance has been updated in response to the lockdown in England that starts tomorrow for four weeks.

    The government in England is asking people to stay at home if at all possible. Stopping ringing during this time is consistent with that request. Churches are closed except for private prayer and broadcast worship. We realise England&apos;s senior faith leaders, including the Bishop of London who heads the C of E Recovery Group, are challenging the government&apos;s decision to ban communal worship during this further lockdown period, but at the moment no exception has been made, and even if it was, our guidance wouldn&apos;t change. This is a much stricter lockdown that Tier 3.

        However, we support the tolling of a single bell on <strong>Remembrance Sunday</strong>, if it is with the permission of the incumbent and churchwardens. This has been specifically approved by the House of Bishops Recovery Group. The tolling of a single bell is a powerful symbol of remembrance understood by communities and will mean a great deal to many. Please be particularly aware of the risks associated with entering a tower and ringing on your own - make sure someone knows you are doing it and can watch out for you. A muffle is not needed when tolling a single bell.
