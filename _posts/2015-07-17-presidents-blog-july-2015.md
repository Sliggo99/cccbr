The sharp eyed will have noticed no blog for June, this was to ensure all the important happenings were rolled into one roundâ€“up.

The May Council meeting has already been well reported in the Ringing World issue of June 15th. The key departure from normal was the break-out sessions enabling representatives to discuss their local problems and successes and ways in which co- operation can face the challenge of future ringing. I would encourage ALL CC REPS to engage with their respective societies and feed back their views.

There was a marvellous response to the appeal for ringing to celebrate Magna Carta 800th Anniversary which seemed to catch the imagination of ringers worldwide. There was a predictably smaller celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the battle of Waterloo. In the autumn there will be yet another anniversary, 600 years since Agincourt.

The national 12-bell competition gave Norwich its second grand event of the year, following on from the 300th First Peal Anniversary in May. Congratulations to ASCY in wresting the trophy from the 5-times winners Birmingham, will there be yet another change of victor next year at Aston?

Just two weeks later, the Ringing World National Youth Competition in Oxford proved once again that there are young people taking up and being passionate about ringing. The enthusiasm was infectious and the Bedfordshire team were again triumphant. It was interesting that a few of those taking part had been in all five years of the competition, no doubt starting at around 13.

All of the good summer events do not hide the fact that there is the continuing debate and work on recruitment and training of new ringers in an ever busier world. Much work is done behind the scenes by Council members and I would ask all members of Committees to redouble efforts to support their respective Chairmen.

Finally, the Church of England has in the past week agreed new guidance for Safer Recruitment of workers and volunteers. Whilst there are no fundamental changes in requirements for ringers there will be an update published shortly.

Many of you will be disappearing on holiday and I hope that you and your families will come back refreshed to serve ringing where you are.
