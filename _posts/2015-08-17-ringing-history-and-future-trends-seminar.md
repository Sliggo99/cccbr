Ringing has a long heritage. It has survived centuries of social upheaval, with modern ringing more advanced than our predecessors might have dreamt. But ringing also faces major challenges for the future. What lessons can we learn from our history to help us face the future?

The study of history itself is changing thanks to new techniques and technology. But is it changing enough or has it changed too much? What will the future of ringing history look like? What challenges will future ringing historians face?

Come to this thought-provoking day, where these ideas and more will be explored with the help of three guest speakers and open discussion.

  * **Richard Johnston**  
    Richard will talk about: &#8216; __**Ringing&apos;s future - sacred or secular**&#8216; – reviewing the legacy of Belfry Reform. Richard is a member of the Exeter Cathedral Society and rings method and Devon style call changes.
  * **David Jones** _ _  
    _ _David will talk about: **&#8216;Contrasting modern and historical issues in ringing&apos;** – and also about a possible place for ringing in academic history. David is master of the Chester Diocesan Guild.
  * **Steve Coleman**  
    ** **Steve will talk about: **&#8216;Women in ringing – the past, the present and the future**.&apos; . Steve is a well known author and secretary of the Gloucester & Bristol Diocesan Association.

There will also be ample time to browse and/or buy items of interest – between sessions and over lunch – all in the friendly surroundings of Wellesbourne Church Centre, with tea/coffee and home made hot lunch are all included.

  * There will be updates on the work of the Library Committee and Biographies Committee
  * Library publications will be on sale, including: Ringing World DVDs 1911-2000, Order & Disorder 18/19C.
  * Other participants may have items for sale.

This event will be of interest to anyone with an interest in the history of ringing – direct or indirect – including ringing society librarians, archivists and ringing historians.
