Recruitment is all fine and dandy but we need to retain our recruits for the long term.  At the mini roadshow we have a number of expert speakers on the subject and materials that support promoting ringing, recruitment and retention.

Confirmed exhibitors relating to promotion, recruitment and retention include:

  * The Ringing World and Bellboard - educating, entertaining and informing change ringers everywhere since 1911 through its weekly paper and more recently its massively popular online resource, BellBoard. Its stand will offer merchandise and the opportunity to subscribe and ask questions;
  * Association of Ringing Teachers - Learn about the ART teaching modules, Learn to Ring programme and purchase merchandise including Bell Handling, Raising & Lowering and Recruitment DVDs, 50 Ringing Things and supporting materials.

Louise Nightingale and members of the Communications & Marketing workgroup will be sharing how to encourage growth and public appreciation of ringing, different routes for fostering recruitment and retention and the ongoing activities of this workgroup.

Vicki Chapman, CCCBR Public Relations Officer and the Project Co-ordinator for the Ringing Remembers campaign will provide a final update on the hugely successful recruitment campaign, and its legacy in terms of recruitment, retention, public and media interest in bell ringing, and why have Ringing Remembers recruits stayed with it.  An interactive session including stories from Ringing Remembers recruits on why they took part, what they get out of ringing and what makes them come back each week.

Emily Ashton, Alison Everett and Deb Margason-Baker will provide us with “The Social Media toolkit: All you need to know to help you use Social Media effectively”, from complete novice to expert.
