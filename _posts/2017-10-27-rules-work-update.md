Following the Council’s decision to implement a programme of reform, as recommended in the proposals of the recent CRAG review, a Working Group was established in August to revise the Council’s rules.

The terms of reference of this group is to incorporate those CRAG recommendations which require rule changes in 2018, particularly those involving the setup of an executive board and workgroups, and to bring the Council’s rules into line with the guidance of the Charity Commission

The first drafts of the proposed new Rules and Procedures, for eventual submission to the May 2018 Council Meeting have now been completed and can be read or downloaded from the Council’s Rules Work pages at  </about/reform/rules/first-draft/>.

It is important to emphasise that these reforms relate to the way in which the Central Council manages its business.  They do not affect society representation and they do not, to the best of our knowledge, require any changes to society constitutions.  .

We would now like to hear the views of societies, Council members and ringers to ensure that the new rules and procedures which are presented to next year&apos;s Council meeting are fit for purpose.

[Read about the new draft Rules and Procedures](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/News-Item-2017-10-27.pdf), and [how to let us have your comments](http://www./about/reform/rules/first-draft- review) here.

The closing date for consultation is **Friday 24<sup>th</sup> November**.
