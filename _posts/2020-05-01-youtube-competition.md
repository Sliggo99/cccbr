A new YouTube competition has been launched today and will run from now until Christmas. Details can be found [here](/youtube-competition/), where there is also a link to a YouTube video on how to make a YouTube ringing video!

This is one of those occasions when I hope you can help in the distribution of this message. This competition will be of particular interest to those ringers who do not use traditional media for their ringing news, particularly young ringers.
