Bellringing has featured in the very popular children&apos;s magazine &#8220;The Week Junior&#8221; in their regular slot of things to try out. The full feature can be found <a href="https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-Week-Junior-article.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>

The sharp-eyed amongst you will notice that the main picture is of ringing in Italy, however the publishers wanted an eye-catching image which had people in as well as bells - we cannot easily supply that with our style of ringing. This marketing is aimed at youngsters and, just as importantly, at the parents of youngsters, who are not too bothered by such technical detail!

Of course it is a shame that we are not currently able to teach any recruits that come directly from this, but we are not alone in not being able to enage with new recruits and so will save the contacts for the future. It is also a nice piece we can use in future recruitment efforts.
