Applications are invited for grants from this Fund, which are paid only for work carried out by the UK bell founders and bell hangers  
on bell restoration projects in countries outside the UK and Ireland.  Details of the allocation criteria and administration procedures and an application form are available from me.  Closing date for applications is 31st January 2020.
