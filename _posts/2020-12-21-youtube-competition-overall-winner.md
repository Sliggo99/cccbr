The prize for the &#8216;People&apos;s Choice&apos; in the Central Council&apos;s monthly YouTube competition, the champion of champions, goes to the Pillaton and St Mellion Handbell Ringers for their video of them ringing a plain course of Plain Bob Triples by the lapping method. This really captured the imagination, with comments describing it variously as &#8216;fabulous&apos;, &#8216;absolutely incredible&apos;, &#8216;brilliant to watch&apos;, &#8216;astonishing&apos;, and even &#8216;soothing&apos;.

If by any chance you missed it, you can watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/CoVZ4iYdTE0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>

Â£200 will therefore be winging its way through the ether to Cornwall, with our congratulations and thanks.

That marks the end of the YouTube competition. We have had some fantastic videos entered, some produced specially, some put onto YouTube for the first time, and some just shared with a wider audience. One of the aims of the competition was to get more examples of good ringing on YouTube and I think we have done that. Thank you to everyone who participated, to Simon Edwards, Ros Martin and Neal Dodge for collaborating with me on the orginal idea, and to Neal and Mark Elvers for dealing with the monthly competitions, website and playlists.
