Few church bell ringers will have had many opportunities to undertake any practical activities in belfries this year. However, we all hope to ring bells in good condition and in safe, pleasant environments, once conditions are safe for us to do so. Ringers are all dependent on the bells in the towers where we ring. Towers and bells in good condition will usually make it easier for ringers to develop their skills and, in particular help new recruits and those returning to ring. So this year we again intend to recognise people who have become involved in belfry maintenance and improvement in the last few years.  The Stewardship & Management Workgroup of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers is launching the 3<sup>rd</sup> award to people who are newly involved in belfry maintenance and improvement, developing their own skills and helping others develop their own skills. The award will be made at the September 2021 CCCBR AGM. The winner will receive £100 and a certificate. Full details and an application form are on the CCCBR website here:

The closing date for nominations will be **noon on Sunday 30<sup>th</sup> May 2021**
