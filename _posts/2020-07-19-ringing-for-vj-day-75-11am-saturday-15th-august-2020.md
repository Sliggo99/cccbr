Due to the restrictions in place at the time, we were unable to mark the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Victory in Europe Day in May.  However, as some towers are now able to hold restricted ringing in one form or another, ringers may wish to mark the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Victory in Japan on 15<sup>th</sup> August to commemorate the final end of the Second World War.

“_Whilst VE Day (Victory in Europe) marked the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, many thousands of Armed Forces personnel were still engaged in bitter fighting in the Far East. Victory over Japan would come at a heavy price, and Victory over Japan Day (VJ Day) marks the day Japan surrendered on the 15 August 1945, which in effect ended the Second World War._

_Fighting in the Asia-Pacific took place from Hawaii to North East India. Britain and the Commonwealth’s principle fighting force, the Fourteenth Army, was one of the most diverse in history – more than 40 languages were spoken, and all the world’s major religions represented_.” - <https://ve-vjday75.gov.uk/vjday/>

The language of bells commemorating significant moments in history is something that we are all familiar with. If it is safe to do so and you have the incumbent’s permission to ring one, or some of your bells to mark this occasion, the suggested time is at 11am on 15<sup>th</sup> August.  Please remember to upload your performance to Bellboard so that all ringing for the day can be gathered together.
