A reminder that the second and final consultation on the new Framework is in progress, with implementation of the framework planned for Q1 2019. If you have any questions or concerns on the framework that have not yet been raised in either consultation, please submit them via the consultation survey by **Nov 30th 2018**.  The draft framework is at <a href="https://framework./" target="_blank" rel="noopener">framework.cccbr.tunbury.org</a>, and Appendix H gives directions on the consultation.
