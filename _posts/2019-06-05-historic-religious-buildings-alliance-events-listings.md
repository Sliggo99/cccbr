A great opportunity to list bellringing events for a wider audience, great for open days and fetes etc. by adding it to the HRBA Events newsletter.Â  Email them at [hrb@theheritagealliance.org.uk](mailto:hrb@theheritagealliance.org.uk "Send an email to hrb@theheritagealliance.org.uk") with the information by the deadline of Friday 21 June 2019 and follow them on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/hrballiance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@hrballiance</a> to find activities in your area that might be good to ring for.
