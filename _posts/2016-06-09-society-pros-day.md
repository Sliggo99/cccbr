The Central Council’s Public Relations Committee is holding a special day for Public Relations Officers of ringing societies on Saturday 25 February 2017 at Wellesbourne. There will be something for everyone, including the opportunity to share good practice, to get to grips with the role if you are new to it or have questions and to hear from experts about working with the media and other PR issues.
