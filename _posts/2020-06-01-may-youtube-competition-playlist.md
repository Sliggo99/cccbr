All entries for the May YouTube competition have been counted and verified and I am delighted to share them in this **[playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmJrg8h0wm_qEMdydGX8FRhOMQNbR-eFN)** (not clicking on the image above). Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to submit entries, and for making the effort to record high quality performance. There is nearly two and a half hours of good ringing here for anyone who wants some inspiration!

Judge for this round of the competition is Matt Hilling, who led the Exeter band to victory in last year&apos;s 12 Bell Contest. Along with many other members of the Exeter band, Matt takes part in call change ringing in Devon so is well placed to appreciated the different styles of ringing on show here.
