I think this is September running late due to leaf fall season!

You will have seen that I was involved with dedication of new 6 at Leek Wootton (RW of 16 October) and the following week, like many of you, ringing for the Queen achieving status as the longest reigning monarch. The response to this was widespread and shows that ringers rise to the occasion for such national events. As I write this the Anniversary of the battle of Agincourt in 1415 is about to take place, no doubt more excuses to ring.

Later in September I had a most interesting meeting with Sir Peter Heywood, grandson of the famous Sir Arthur Heywood who was President of the CCCBR, method and composition composer and also narrow gauge railway builder. The discussion surrounded plans to celebrate both the 125th Anniversary of the Council&apos;s first meeting in 2016 and the centenary of Sir Arthur&apos;s death. Plans are being developed to hold a weekend of activities centred on Duffield over the weekend of 23rd /24th April. Yes it is also Shakespeare&apos;s birthday and close to the Queen&apos;s &#8220;real&#8221; 90th birthday but keep the date in your diary, more information to follow.

The start of October saw a meeting to discuss improvements to the Council website and other IT based services which are being progressed. This was followed by a review of Methods and associated &#8220;Decisions&#8221; at Southwark, a preliminary report having already appeared in the RW (page 1030). Whilst this is a highly technical and specialised subject it does cover all our four centuries of change ringing tradition.

The most recent gathering was the CC Admin Committee which looked to next year&apos;s Council in Portsmouth, the forthcoming survey by the Trends Committee which is most important, and other necessary business.

Finally, you will be aware that the Ringing World Board has been examining the future and finances and shape of the ringing World and has been grateful for discussion and suggestions put forward from ringers. In order to be further informed on the desires of ringers regarding the newspaper, it is the intention to take a survey of all interested persons including existing subscribers. Please keep an eye open for further information on the launch of this survey shortly.

In between ringing activities I did manage to get a trip on the reopened Borders Railway from Edinburgh to Tweedbank - by steam, superb.
