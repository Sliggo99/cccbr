**PRESS RELEASE**   PRESS RELEASE   **PRESS RELEASE**   PRESS RELEASE

Twelve members (including the two overseas members by Skype) met for the first time on Saturday 13<sup>th</sup> August in central Birmingham for an all day session. They were joined by CCCBR members Ruth Marshall and John Harrison who acted as facilitators.

The group discussed the strengths of the current structure, the opportunities to develop the exercise and the creation of a modern structure to promote ringing, foster new initiatives and enrich people’s ringing.  The group developed a programme of action and will meet regularly face to face and electronically over the coming months.

A number of sub-groups were established to focus on key activities, including creating a vision for the future and developing a strategy for consulting widely and obtaining input from all stakeholders including grass roots ringers, new ringers and non-ringers.

Further information, including how everyone can input into this process will follow soon.
