November was the last month of the Central Council’s YouTube competition, although details of the “People’s Choice” award can be found below. November’s category was “Film that promotes ringing in the most positive way.”

Nikki Thomas was the judge. Nikki is the Manager of the <a href="https://www.mrdc.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mancroft Ringing Discovery Centre</a> in Norwich, one of the best centres for the promotion of ringing and training of ringers. She had the following to say about the entries:

“This was so hard to judge - I am convinced it’s easier judging a striking competition than trying to pick out the winner from these excellent entries.

I straight away spotted a favourite, <a href="https://youtu.be/lcGgD1jomxE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ringing for the Ghosts of Today</em></a> - I’ve already watched this a few times and it’s wonderful. I wasn’t convinced that it is promoting bellringing as such, but it delves deep into the feeling of how we feel when we ring. It is an amazing video and a joy to watch.

Chris Richmond has two entries. I have got to know Chris well over the past couple of years, he produces a high quality video and is an expert in sound recording. It’s tempting to award the prize to Chris, someone is sure to spot me in his videos so best not on this occasion. Chris deserves to be awarded highly commended for his <a href="https://youtu.be/ivZthF6ZI3o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two entries</a>.

<a href="https://youtu.be/l0mYK8QQx8w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ringing Room, a Virtual Belltower</em></a> also needs to be highly commended, another high quality entry. Professional, informative, and brief.

However the video that matches the brief and is professional and therefore the winner is the <a href="https://youtu.be/hMFBgY-_dOE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>King’s Nympton Bellringing Documentary</em></a> - it says everything that is good about ringing, building a band and how ringing can play a strong part in your community. I can’t wait for another chance to visit King’s Nympton when we can ring again.”

&nbsp;

Congratulations to the band at King’s Nympton then, not only for this excellent video which I hope many people will see, but also the example they have set of how you can build a band in a rural village which becomes part of the community. I hope they go from strength to strength. A £25 Amazon voucher will wing its way to North Devon.

So finally, we come to the competition for the People’s Choice, the crowd-pleasing favourite of all the individual cateogory winners. If you now go to the <a href="http://www./youtube-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">competition website</a> you will find a playlist of all the winners, or you can look at them from the individual months. We will post a poll on the Bell Ringing and Bellringers Facebook groups, and will also accept email nominations of the winner sent to the email address youtube@cccbr.tunbury.org Closing date will be Sunday 20th December to enable the winner to be announced the £200 prize awarded in time for Christmas.
