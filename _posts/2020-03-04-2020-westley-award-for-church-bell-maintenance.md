Ringers are all dependent on the bells that they ring.  Towers and bells in good condition will usually make it easier for ringers to develop their skills and, in particular, help retain new recruits.  So have you or one of your band become involved in belfry maintenance relatively recently?

If so, then the Westley Award for church bell maintenance is for you!  The Stewardship & Management Workgroup of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers is launching the 2020 award for people who are newly involved in belfry maintenance, developing their own skills and those of others.  The award will be made at the September 2020 CCCBR annual conference to be held in Nottingham.  The winner will receive £100 and a certificate.  Full details and an application form are available here:

The closing date for nominations is **noon on 31<sup>st</sup> May 2020.**
