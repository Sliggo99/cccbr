Right on the doorstep of Christmas I hope that this blog reaches you over the festive period and I will not repeat the “end of year” message in the RW issue of 18th December.

Recently we took a late holiday in Scandinavia enjoying unseasonably warm weather, trams, trains, Viking ships and travelling across the famous Oresund Bridge (yes the one in the TV series). Following this the run up to Christmas has been busy as it is for most people. I was privileged to speak at the Worcestershire & Districts Association Dinner and the next day attended the Ringing World Board meeting at which the all-important future of “our journal” was to the fore.

More local Warwick ringers prepared for the town&apos;s Victorian Evening which was a huge success with an estimated 2,500 people passing through St. Mary&apos;s church in one evening. A big attraction was the third (now annual) Christmas Tree Festival and the ringers&apos; tree won best prize for the second time. Our Guild Carol service included ringing on the newly augmented 6 at Leek Wootton drew over 80 members and featured a real ringer&apos;s baby in the Nativity story.

Our Guild team which entered the National Youth Competition have all been encouraged to continue their advancement with special practices being arranged. What is more all but one of the team members have managed to ring a peal during the current year, it is possible to keep interest going.

Did you see?

  * Record length peal of Cambridge Maximus at South Petherton, RW 20 Nov.
  * Launch of ART Awards scheme, RW 27 Nov.
  * Success of major event at Tulloch Ringing Centre with no less than 29 quarters and 3 peals scored and many &#8220;firsts&#8221;, RW 27 Nov.
  * Reporting of our two &#8220;senior&#8221; societies, the College Youths and Cumberlands, which coincide in the RW issue of 11th December.

The Ringing World survey launched on 4th December has seen tremendous response both from subscribers and, importantly, non-subscribers. The future shape of the journal could well be influenced by views expressed and if you haven&apos;t completed the questionnaire yet please do so.

There are plenty of ringing opportunities and challenges for 2016, in the meantime best wishes for New Year and new endeavours.

_Chris Mew, President CCCBR_
