The 8<sup>th</sup> May 2020 marks the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of the second World War in Europe.  It provides us with an opportunity to remember the sacrifice made at home and abroad which heralded the arrival of peace, despite conflict still taking place in other parts of the world.

The UK Government has moved the early May Day Bank Holiday from the Monday to Friday 8<sup>th</sup> May so that as many people as possible can take part in the celebrations that day.

At 7pm on 8<sup>th</sup> May 2020 church bells are invited to ring out for peace.  The Central Council encourages all ringers to respond as they see fit, taking into account the wide variety of local circumstances. Ringing open at 7pm (local time wherever you are in the world) is the ideal and recommended option, but any time that afternoon / evening, and indeed throughout the weekend of events planned, is also supported.

A full programme of planned events is listed on the VEDay75 website and to register your intention to ring go to <a href="https://www.veday75.org/register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.veday75.org/register/</a> which takes you to a Ringing Out for Peace registration page.  In due course there will also be a Bellboard event set up where you will be able to register and from where you will be able to download a Certificate of Grateful Recognition to record your ringing on the day.

Any further advice received about plans for the weekend will be publicised when they become known.
