Bells having been ringing out to celebrate 100 years since the passing of theÂ Representation of the People Act (1918) which first granted for women the right to vote.

Over 50 peals or quarters have been scored to celebrate the occasion. You can see some of them on BellBoard [here](http://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/event.php?id=7720)

Ringers in both [Ramsbottom](http://www.burytimes.co.uk/news/15986848.Church_bell_ringers_mark_centenary_of_women_getting_the_vote/) and [Ross-on-Wye](http://www.rossgazette.com/article.cfm?id=110936&headline=Ross-on-Wye%20bell%20ringers%20honour%20suffragettes&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2018) have both been featured in the local press for their efforts.
