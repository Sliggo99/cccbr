The Ecclesiastical Insurance &#8220;movement for good&#8221; grants are now open for nominations.  Please consider nominating CCCBR for a grant, using this link:

<https://www.ecclesiastical.com/movement-for-good/nominate-a-charity/>

CCCBR&apos;s registered charity number is 270036, and the most relevant charity category is &#8220;heritage arts&#8221;.  The nomination form asks why are you are nominating, so perhaps you could say:

&#8220;CCCBR provides support, advice and training services for bell ringers.  All bell ringers and CCCBR office bearers are volunteers.  A charitable grant will assist CCCBR to enhance and augment these services, providing for the continuity and development of this unique community activity.&#8221;
