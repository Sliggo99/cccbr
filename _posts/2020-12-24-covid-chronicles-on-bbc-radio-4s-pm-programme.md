Bellringers Thomas Ashwin-Siejkowski and John Hall took part in BBC Radio 4â€™s PM Programme call for articles recording thoughts of Covid and entered articles about what the restrictions have meant to them in terms of not being able to ring bells. They were interviewed and their piece aired on Christmas Eve. The audio file can be listened to here:
