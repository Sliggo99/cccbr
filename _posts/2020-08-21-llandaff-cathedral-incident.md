The Central Council has heard of an incident at Llandaff Cathedral involving a bell ringer on 20th August and has tried to contact to locals to understand the situation.&nbsp; We have been asked to make comment in the Press, however without first hand information it would be wrong to speculate as to what happened.&nbsp; Our thoughts are with the injured bell ringer and we wish them a speedy recovery.&nbsp; Thankfully, such incidences are rare thanks to appropriate safety precautions and teaching methods in the belfry. An update will be shared if and when appropriate. For advice on tower safety please see </resources/stewardship-and-management/>
