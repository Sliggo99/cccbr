In normal times, Easter Sunday marks a welcome return to ringing after Holy Week’s abstinence, a week in which handbell ringing flourishes, ringing chambers get a spring clean and pub sessions start earlier. This Easter, however, is a time when we may miss ringing even more, whether that is ringing to mark the most important Christian festival, or Easter Monday’s traditional focus on ringing outings, quarters and peals.

Let us all hope and pray that it will not be too long before we can ring again, both to call people to worship as we would have done today, and for the enjoyment, camaraderie and stimulation that ringing gives us. We must continue to look after ourselves and each other.

A very happy Easter to all
