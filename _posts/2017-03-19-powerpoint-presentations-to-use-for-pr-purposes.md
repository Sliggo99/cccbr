Want to tell other people about bell ringing?  Not sure how to get the facts together in the best way?  Or don&apos;t have the time to create your own presentation?

A small working group of volunteers, led by Caroline Stockmann, have come up with a number of presentations which are there for you to tailor and use in a variety of situations.  In summary they are:

  * a general overview of bell ringing
  * a presentation to those particularly interested in the science and mathematics of it all
  * a presentation for those interested particularly in the history
  * a &#8216;recruitment&apos; presentation.

Still to come in the next weeks are:

  * a template for bell restoration funding applications
  * a recruitment presentation for youth
  * a &#8216;tower leaflet&apos; - with generic content as well as areas for specifics of your tower; this is an aid to help you create your own leaflet if you don&apos;t have one.

The presentations have guidance notes; the pages themselves have minimum content, as intended for presentation rather than reading.

We hope some of you will find these resources useful! </services/pr/bells-and-bellringing/>
