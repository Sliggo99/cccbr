The [Church of England](https://www.churchofengland.org/resources/churchcare/our-conservation-grants/grants-historic-church-interiors-and-churchyard#bells-and-bell-frames) provides grants of up to £10,000 for the conservation of bells and bell frames in Anglican parish churches in England.

The fund is for the conservation of bells and bell frames of artistic, historic, archaeological or architectural significance. They may be:

  * Listed by the [Church Buildings Council](https://www.churchofengland.org/more/church-resources/churchcare/advice-and-guidance-church-buildings/bells-and-bell-ringing){.u-mouseBlur} 
  * Cast before 1700
  * Significant bells and bell frames of a later date

These grants are offered in partnership with the Pilgrim Trust and are awarded around 12 weeks after the application deadline.

**Next closing date: 22 February 2021  
** **Decision: May 2021**
