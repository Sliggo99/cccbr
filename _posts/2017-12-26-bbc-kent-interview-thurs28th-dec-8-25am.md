Do tune in to listen to this if you can (will post after the event). Caroline Levy-Cooper of Cowden tower talks about Harold Ladd who was a ringer who died in action Dec 30th 1917.  His brother Ernie left a great legacy, teaching Stan and Ann Jenner, who have gone on to teach many others.  Who knows what Harold might also have achieved?
