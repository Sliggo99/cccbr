Don&apos;t miss this opportunity to join ringers around the UK between now and Children in Need night (Nov 17th), raising funds for a good cause.  Pick anything you like, whether the method Pudsey or rounds and call changes, as long as has a bit of challenge in it, and get friends, colleagues and family to sponsor you to raise funds for Children in Need.  No doubt this initiative will further raise (positive) awareness of ringing in our communities.

[You can donate online here](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/cinbellringing)

For our overseas colleagues: please do not feel excluded, although we realise this is a UK charity. We would love you to join in!

Please find attached two versions of a sponsorship form - one intended for you to tailor to your needs before printing (&#8216;form to modify&apos;), and the other for those of you who want to simply print and add details manually (&#8216;to complete by hand&apos;)!
