In this week&apos;s episode, Vicki Chapman talks podcast host Cathy Booth through her involvement in the overwhelmingly successful Ringing Remembers campaign –  from that fateful telephone call one evening to the bells ringing out across the world on 11 November 2018 with the help of over 2800 new ringers. Stirring stuff!
