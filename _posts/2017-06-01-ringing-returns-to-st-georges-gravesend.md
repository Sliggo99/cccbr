  Absent for around 20 years, regular bell ringing is back at St George’s Church in Gravesend, Kent after rector Chris Stone approached Peter Joyce to teach a band back in 2015.

  The bells can now be heard on Sundays, Wednesdays for practice and during special services and events.  The bells have been rung in support of Strike Back Against Blood Cancer, and will ring out on 15th June 2017 as part of BBC Music Day.
