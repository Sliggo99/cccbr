The Association of Ringing Teachers is getting frequent enquiries about how to arrange or attend one of their courses.  They have prepared <a href="https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ART-Course-info.pdf" target="_blank">this document</a> that you may find of assistance if you are thinking of arranging such a course.  Please pass this on to your branch/district officers as it is often at branch level that these courses are arranged.
