I am one of the CC Reps for Essex and have served on the Essex Management Committee for over 25 years.  During that time some of the roles I’ve held include Association Secretary, Education Officer and Convenor of the Essex Ringing Course.  Since joining the CC in 2016 I have been an active member of the former PR Committee and latterly the Comms & Marketing and the Volunteering & Leadership Workgroups.

In 2017 I was appointed as the CC’s project co-ordinator for the Ringing Remembers campaign and led the promotion of ringing and the recruitment of over 3,000 new ringers.  During this time I liaised heavily with local, national and international media, the Department of Digital, Culture, Media & Sports, the Ministry of Local Government & Housing, and third party organisations such as The Big Ideas Company.  This has provided me with an excellent resource of contacts.

I am currently leading on the promotion of the CC’s annual meeting and mini-roadshow in London in September 2019 at Goldsmiths College (</about/annual-meetings/2019-meeting/>)

I am keen to explore new avenues to promote the world of bell ringing to the wider community and foster links with external organisations, as well as promote the work and support of the CC within the ringing fraternity.

Outside of ringing I manage a 65 strong team in an acute NHS Trust, and when time permits, I bake the odd cake!!
