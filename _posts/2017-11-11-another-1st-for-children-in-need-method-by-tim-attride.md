As many ringers will know, the “Julie McDonnell” methods & variations originated in All Saints, Birchington with the doubles variation - intended just as a “Thank-You” to Julie. Having seen the “A Peal for Pudsey” plea, but not having enough ringers with the confidence to ring “Pudsey”, we decided that we attempt another first for Children in Need.

This time it was “Camelion” with a “Ready Money Single”. So, on Tuesday, 24th October the six regular QP ringers, surrounded by cameras, videos & audio recorders, rang a quick 120 to get into the swing of it. After a brief pause to fire up the recorders, we set off. Thirty-six minutes later, after some intense concentration and, overall, a very tidy set of ringing, we came back into rounds for the final time.

Hopefully, this variation is approachable by other towers like ours & will be rung & sponsored many times in the future.
