Alison Hodge and members of the Stewardship & Management Workgroup will be asking what is Stewardship & Management and who is involved? This is your opportunity to raise your and possibly get involved!

Peter Tottman and Michael Royalton-Kisch will share their experience of succeeding with bells restoration projects in urban and rural contexts.  They will cover the process from start to finish hoping that others will be inspired to tackle what can be a daunting task but ultimately very rewarding.

Mike Banks will give a brief introduction to basic sound level measurement and suggest target sound levels. He’ll offer tips on how to avoid excessive sound levels in the first place and how to understand causes of existing problems and instigate effective solutions. Several examples of work already carried out to control sound levels both in ringing rooms and external to the tower will be discussed to put the theory into perspective.

Tom Westley will include in his talk the history of Westley Group and its historic development since 1800, as well as an explanation of the relationship with Whitechapel Bell Foundry and the continuing production of tower bells using 21st Century technologies.

Next time we’ll take a closer look at the offerings under History & Heritage.
