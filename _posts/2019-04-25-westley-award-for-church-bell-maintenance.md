**A new award for belfry maintenance**

All ringers, including new ringers such as those recruited through the Ringing Remembers campaign, depend on the bells and towers that they ring being in usable condition. Good bells usually mean that it is easier to develop ringers’ skills and, in particular, help retain new recruits. So are you or one of your band getting involved in belfry maintenance? If so, then a new  award for people involved in maintenance of tower bells is for you! The Stewardship & Management Workgroup of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers is launching an award for people who have recently become involved in belfry maintenance, are developing their own skills and those of others. The first award will be made at the September 2019 CCCBR annual conference to be held in London. The winner will receive £100 and a certificate. For more information and to download an application form, please [click here](/about/workgroups/stewardship-and-management/westley-award/).

The closing date for nominations is **noon on 28<sup>th</sup> June 2019**.
