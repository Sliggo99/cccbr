This audio link of interviews with Eric Hitchins and Dennis Brock, with BBC News Religious Affairs correspondent Martin Bashir about ringing on VE Day was recorded to be played on BBC Radio 4’s PM programme on the 75<sup>th</sup>Anniversary of VE Day, 8<sup>th</sup> May. Unfortunately, scheduling clashes following announcements from the government meant that it wasn’t aired, for which I understand that Mr Bashir has personally apologised to Eric and Dennis.
