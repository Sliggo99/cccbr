2019 is a special year for the CCT, as they are celebrating caring for historic places of worship for 50 years. To mark this momentous half-century milestone CCT’s Chief Executive, Peter Aiers, will be racing non-stop against the clock to visit 50 churches in 50 hours!

Peter will start his journey in Portland, Dorset on Thursday 25th of July before travelling up the country to the CCT’s most northerly churches and back down to finish in London on Saturday 27th of July. A number of towers with bells are on his route, so why not arrange some ringing to spur him on his way and let the local community know about the work CCT does.

<a href="https://www.visitchurches.org.uk/steeple-chase.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The route has been fully mapped out and can be viewed here</a>.

During his journey Peter will travel using a wide range of transport; including a helicopter, van and motorbike provided by E-bound AVX and an assortment of vintage vehicles sourced by The Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs, alongside a campervan, bicycles and even a Pedicab.

Along the way Peter will meet with volunteers and local groups whose work is crucial for caring for historic churches and showcase the innovative ways historic churches can be brought to life.

You can support the fight against heritage crime by donating to The Great National Steeple Chase campaign. Your donations will have a real impact in helping us to fight back and protect our churches across the country.
