**An online talk by Vicki Chapman (Wednesday 30th September, 7pm (UK))**

Join Vicki Chapman, PR Rep for the Central Council, as she leads us in a discussion about public relations in ringing. Vicki will focus both on ringing PR in general and for towers.

This is the first in a series of talks offered jointly by the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers and the St Martin&apos;s Guild.

Sign up to register your interest below for Vicki&apos;s talk on Wednesday 30th September, starting at 7pm (UK). Please register before Tuesday evening as Zoom details will be sent later on the 29th September. Email <smgcbr@gmail.com> if you have any issues or questions. All personal details will be deleted immediately after the talk.

To register: <https://forms.gle/fGEbMXsVVxeLeBdk7>

In the event that we reach capacity, members of the St Martin&apos;s Guild and Central Council would be given first priority. Non-members are warmly welcome (and in the event that we reach capacity would be welcomed on a first come first served basis. However, registering in advance will hopefully allow us to increase capacity if needed).
