The Church Buildings Council (CBC) are looking for people who have an interest or expertise in the fields of history, heritage and the care and conservation of church buildings, with time and skills to serve on one of the expert advisory groups.  Joining a Fabric Advisory Committee (FAC), Diocesan Advisory Committee (DAC) or Parochial Church Council (PCC) as a bellringer will give you the opportunity to bring imagination, insight, and new and diverse perspectives to bear on the significance of our churches and cathedrals and the challenges they face. You don’t have to be there as a Bell Advisor but having an opportunity to shape understanding of the needs of bells and bellringers would greatly increase the Church’s knowledge and support.

Of particular interest on these groups is the area of Care of Collections, which includes the conservation of buildings and objects (including organs, bells, clocks, paintings, wall paintings, sculpture, furnishings, and stained glass).  To find out more visit <https://www.churchofengland.org/resources/churchcare/churchcare-news/expressions-interest-sought-cathedral-fabric-advisory#na>

Applications are welcomed from competent and experienced and experienced professionals who can commit to meeting several times a year (in person, under normal circumstances), and occasional site visits. These roles are voluntary but reasonable travel expenses will be paid.

To express your interest, please send a CV and covering letter to <churchcare@churchofengland.org> to arrive by **Monday 11th January 2021**.
