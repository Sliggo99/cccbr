CBBC have informed us today that the Blue Peter episode that will include the filming done at the Ringing World National Youth Contest in July will now be shown on **Thursday 22nd November **at 5.30pm, not this Thursday as originally planned.  Please let everyone know about the change so they don&apos;t miss it!
