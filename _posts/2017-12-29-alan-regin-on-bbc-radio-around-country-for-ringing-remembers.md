Alan was interviewed for the following BBC radio stations this morning: Wiltshire, Northamptonshire, Channel Islands, Gloucestershire, 3 Counties (Bed, Herts, Bucks), Cornwall, Surrey & Sussex, Humberside, Leeds, Lincolnshire and Devon. Between 8-10am. Some live and some recorded and do not yet have links - but you may like to search your local station’s replay function.

If you have heard one and can indicate to me region and time I would really appreciate it!  <caroline.stockmann@gmail.com>
