The speakers and topics for the 2020 ART Conference have just been released.  From well-known ringing names to unknown teachers doing great things to those who are bringing new ways of thinking from outside the world of bell ringing there should be something for everyone.

The Central Council’s Volunteering & Leadership group will once again be hosting the Sunday of the ART Conference. With a focus on recruitment and retention we will look at how to look after your new ringers so that they blossom and enjoy their new hobby. Hearing from recent recruits, sharing ideas, initiatives and experience through grouped activities will provide you with ideas to take your recruitment and retention plans forward. Look out for booking information soon, but put the date in your diary now. See you there!

The ART Conference is open to ALL ringers. Booking opens early January but put the date in your diary now – **14 and 15 March 2020 at Hilton Village, Derbyshire**.
