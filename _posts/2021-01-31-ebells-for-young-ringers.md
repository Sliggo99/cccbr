As advertised in the President’s Blog and the Association of Ringing Teachers’ news release, the CC and ART are managing a programme of getting pairs of eBells to young ringers (under 25) at the heavily discounted price of £25 a pair.  Sponsorship from The Whiting Society has already funded 26 pairs of eBells, some of which are already in the hands of young ringers. However, as expected, demand has exceeded the funding available and so we are looking for donations so that more young ringers can benefit from this innovation and develop their handbell ringing during lockdown and beyond.

If you are able to make a donation, please email <lesley.belcher@bellringing.org> and we will let you know where to send funds. The subsidy on one pair of eBells is about £75 but any donations will be gratefully received. Three associations have now said that that will provide the subsidy on behalf of their young ringers, and that is something that other associations might like to consider. We could match associations with those who have applied or you could advertise the offer to your young ringers directly.

Finally, some young ringers with new eBells will be looking for opportunities to ring handbells with more experienced bands. If you are interested in helping with that please let us know as it could be an extension to the Cast of 1000 initiative.
