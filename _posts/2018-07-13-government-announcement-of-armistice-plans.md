The Department of Digital, Culture, Media & Sports have now announced plans for the International Moment as the Nations says ‘Thank you’. <a href="https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180712-10000-TO-MARCH-PAST-THE-CENOTAPH-AS-THE-NATION-SAYS-THANK-YOU.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Please see this Press Release</a> that coincided with the announcement made today (12th July) on the BBC’s The One Show.

Bells in countries observing GMT and CET are invited to ring at 12.30hrs GMT (13.30hrs CET)

  * Bells in countries throughout the rest of the world are invited to ring at either 12.30 GMT or 12.30pm local time
  * DCMS is also supporting the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government on an initiative ‘Ringing Remembers’ which is run jointly by the Big Ideas Company and the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers. This project aims to get 1,400 people ringing church bells on the centenary of the Armistice, the number of bell ringers lost in the war.

Ringing Remembers: Bells ring out to mark the centenary of the Armistice

The UK Government invites all bell ringers to join the nation in marking the end of the First World War by ringing together on Remembrance Sunday. They would like ringing to take place at 12.30pm on Sunday 11 November to coincide with the nation’s tribute as thousands march past the Cenotaph. Everybody is invited to take part, whether you are a new Ringing Remembers recruit or an experienced ringer. All are welcome. If you haven’t done so already speak with your tower captain to start making plans for ringing during this national moment.

Share your plans with us and we’ll spread the word to inspire other ringers. Contact: <bells@big-ideas.org>
