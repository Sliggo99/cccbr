**ABOUT THE 2019 MINI-ROADSHOW** 

The Sunday of the weekend (Sunday 8<sup>th</sup> September) takes the form of the London 2019 Mini-roadshow at Goldsmiths College, SE14 6NW which is open to all ringers and anyone interested in ringing living in the London area and beyond. The full programme including all towers and speakers has now been confirmed and can be found at </about/annual-meetings/2019-meeting/mini-roadshow/>.

The programme of 21 speaker events brings together acknowledged experts from all parts of the ringing community, including Bill Hibbert, Simon Linford, Lesley Belcher and Steve Coleman. Subjects are as diverse as the science of bell tuning, the story behind Ringing Remembers, and Project Pickled Egg. A further seventeen stands include the unique Carter Ringing Machine, the Central Council’s library on tour and stands from a wide range of trade suppliers and ringing organisations including Westley Group, John Taylor & Co., ART, Whiting Society, Avon Ropes and the Cumbria Clock Company.

In addition, the Mini-roadshow will feature Training Bells from Matthew Higby, Saxilby and others to try out.  Outside the hall three mini-rings will be available.

To mark London 2019, service ringing will be taking place at eleven City and nearby churches whose bells are not often rung for Sunday services, along with four other churches at the request of the local band. The list of towers includes some iconic City of London churches as well as others within easy travelling distance of Goldsmiths College whose bells are not often heard.

**IS IT FOR ME?**

The Mini-roadshow welcomes all ringers, of all levels and indeed anyone who would like to find out more about ringing.  Whether you’ve been ringing for six months or sixty years, you’ll almost certainly find something new and interesting.

The Mini-roadshow builds on the success of the last Ringing Roadshow at Newbury in 2014, which attracted over 2,000 ringers and led to the suggestion of a regular annual event bringing ringing organisations, trade suppliers and ringers together in the years inbetween major roadshow festivals. The Central Council have devoted some seed funding to this year’s first mini-roadshow and if successful it will be used as a model for future events.

Goldsmiths College, close to New Cross Gate station is conveniently located for travel from all parts of London and the South East. There is plenty of space for a picnic on College Green if the weather is kind, or Goldsmiths has a licensed café offering a range of sandwiches, drinks and real ale.
