The Pillaton and St Mellion Handbell Ringers have been declared the winner of the August YouTube contest with their performance of Plain Bob Triples.

The judge was Pippa Hyde, a teacher of mathematics and music at Cobham Free School (introduced by pupil George Hart). Pippa had the following to say in making her judgement:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    &#8220;What a fascinating task! Maths and bell-ringing sounds like a bizarre combination, but makes sense now, and it&apos;s interesting to see all the different named sequences (please excuse my loose use of terminology).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Judging between such varied presentations is probably impossible, especially given my paucity of knowledge, so I imposed some arbitrary criteria to help me. One was that I liked the idea of it being a recent performance, rather than an older one, although it was also interesting seeing the 78 version, as well as some impressive older live performances. A second was visual interest/presentation, and a third was to try to find performances I liked for different reasons. My results are:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Winner: video no. 1 - by the Pillaton and St Mellion Handbell Ringers; I found this easy to follow and very clear, and nice presentation too. Really good that all the ringers were facing forward (although I can wholly understand facing each other, routinely) but it seemed a very clear, unfussy but well-put-together performance. Well done to the ladies!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There were three that I felt should be highly commended - and here my personal preferences probably show my ignorance more than judgement, but still&#8230;. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My second-favourite performance was the &#8216;Covid Mitigations&apos; video by Phillip and Sheila George - &#8216;Nutbells&apos; - which was both slick and whimsical in its wry (?) use of face masks and social distance; I also liked the brief jingles at front and back.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My third was the technical representation of &#8216;Blueline visualised&apos; which, to me, was more clearly explanatory than some of the other technical solutions, and attractively subtle to watch.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I also rather liked the &#8216;Handbell stadium&apos; presentation with its sharp-suited, sunglass-wearing gangster-type ringers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I do hope these results won&apos;t put anyone&apos;s noses out of joint; I really am fairly clueless about bellringing, but I&apos;ve really enjoyed my opportunity to explore it in more depth. As adjudicators often say (but with justification) they&apos;re all winners really  - well done, everyone!&#8221;
  </p>

So well done to the Pillaton and St Mellion Handbell Ringers and the usual £25 Amazon voucher will be winging its way to you. Yet another victory for the South West!<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
