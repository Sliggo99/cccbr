**Less than a month to go**

With less than a month to go now until 11<sup>th</sup> November I’m sure your plans for ringing to commemorate the centenary of the Armistice are pretty much firmed up by now.  HM Government is encouraging muffled/half-muffled ringing for the 11am Act of Remembrance followed by open ringing at 12:30pm to align with the processions and marches in celebration of peace.  The Central Council encourages all ringers to respond as they see fit, taking into account the wide variety of local circumstances. Ringing open at or around 12:30pm is the ideal and recommended option, but any time that afternoon / evening is also supported.

There is likely to be another upsurge in interest from local and national media in the run up to the day, and it would be great to be able to capture all that good news.  Please do share with us your stories and send links to any press or media you are involved in.

You can now add your proposed ringing to the Bell Board event at <a href="https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/event.php?id=9128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/event.php?id=9128</a> After you have rung on the day, you can then add your performance (with photos and stories if you wish) so that they can be collated and printed in the Ringing World soon after the 11th November, so please remember to link your performance to this event as soon as possible. Associated performances will be held to be printed together.

You will also be able to download a certificate from Bell Board after your ringing on the day, so that you can record the names of ALL ringers that took part at your tower.

The government would also like people to register their ringing events at <a href="https://armistice100.org.uk/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://armistice100.org.uk/events/</a>  Those ringing should simply click on ’add your bell ringing event’, enter the details and it will appear on the map. You don’t need to register.

We have now reached over 2,000 new recruits that have registered on the Ringing Remembers database <a href="https://a100./register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://a100./register/</a> indicating that they are already ringing in rounds, putting both strokes together, or had their first lessons.  It is really important that recruits update their status and ensure that their postal address is accurate, so that we know they are actively ringing as we are starting to post out their special, limited edition Ringing Remembers badges. We’ve already sent out over 1,200 badges to those indicating that they are able to ring rounds without help or can ring both strokes.

For those of you that might like a bit more of a challenge, there are a number of associated methods to try.  A selection has been provided by Graham John, lead for the Technical & Taxonomy Workgroup including:

  * Memorial Bob Doubles;
  * Armistice Day Delight Minor;
  * Remembrance Surprise Minor;
  * Armistice Surprise Major;
  * Ypres Surprise Major;
  * Eleventh Hour Delight Royal

Armistice Day Delight Minor

Whatever you ring on the day, I’m sure that it will be poignant for everyone.  As well as remembering the 1,400 bell ringers who did not return, we remember all those who lost their lives, as well as those that fought and returned home safely, and everyone affected by The Great War.

Again, I would like to thank all of you who have been involved in recruiting, teaching and encouragement of this magnificent response to the Ringing Remembers campaign.  I wish you and all your new recruits the very best for ringing on 11<sup>th</sup> November and look forward to reporting back after the event on the successes and stories.3
