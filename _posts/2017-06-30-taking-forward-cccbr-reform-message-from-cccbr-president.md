  <strong>Calling all ringers!</strong>
</p>

It&apos;s now a month since the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers had their annual meeting in Edinburgh. At that meeting, among other things, the Council voted to embark on an ambitious programme of reform.

This communique is a call to all ringers to express interest in being involved in the reformed central organisation.

The attached information highlights short term actions, and explains how to indicate interest in any of the identified roles.

Do please read the attached / link, and circulate to other ringers as widely as possible.

Kind regards,

_**Christopher O&apos;Mahony**_  
_ **President**_  
_ **CCCBR**_
