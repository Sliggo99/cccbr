The Central Council and Association of Ringing Teachers (ART) are working together to produce information and support to ringers, teachers, tower captains etc. The first newsletter is now available [linked here](https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201207-Survival-Recovery-Newsheet-Issue-1.pdf). Coming soon there will also be a special edition of Tower Talk.
