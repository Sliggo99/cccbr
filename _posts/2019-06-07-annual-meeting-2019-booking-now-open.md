I am pleased to announce that the outline programme of events and the online booking form for this years’ Central Council meeting from 6-8<sup>th</sup> September 2019 based at Goldsmiths College, London is now available on the Central Council’s website: </about/annual-meetings/2019-meeting/>

The programme is open to all ringers and I hope you will find a great deal to interest you, whether it is the social evening on Friday 6th September, the chance to come and discuss the Council’s work on Saturday 7th September, the mini roadshow, exhibition and speaker events taking place on Sunday 8th September, or the opportunity to visit St. Paul’s Cathedral and ring at some iconic London churches.

Over the coming months we will be sharing more information about the speakers, exhibitors and opportunities available at the mini roadshow.
