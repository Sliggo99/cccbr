The ringing community may be understandably confused regarding alternative requests for ringing on 11th November this year. I hope that the following provides some clarification.

“Ringing Remembers” is the campaign officially endorsed and sponsored by HM Government for (a) recruiting new ringers and (b) ringing open at 12:30pm on Sunday 11th November – aligning with the published agenda for processions and marches in celebration of peace. CCCBR has been working hard with government officials to finalise and announce plans for ringing on the centenary of the Armistice, but we were under strict embargo until Friday 13th July, which is when the media release was published.

“Battle’s Over” is the private initiative of Bruno Peek, MBE. Bruno has demonstrated energy, drive and passion to put together a compelling programme of events on the evening of 11th November, inviting ringing at 7:05pm. Although his initiative gained early support from various military organisations and CCCBR, it is not backed by central government or Buckingham Palace.

Over the past year CCCBR representatives have been trying to align the varying requests for ringing on 11th November (we have also had approaches from the British Legion and other bodies), but this has not proved possible. Nevertheless, knowing the national mood to acknowledge this centenary, CCCBR encourages all ringers to respond as they see fit, taking into account the wide variety of local circumstances. Ringing open at or around 12:30pm is the ideal and recommended option, but any time that afternoon / evening is also supported. General ringing, quarter peals, peals – let’s do it!

To quote Tennyson – “…

Ring out old shapes of foul disease;  
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;  
Ring out the thousand wars of old,  
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
