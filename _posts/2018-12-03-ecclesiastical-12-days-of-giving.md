Each “nomination” via their website is like a raffle ticket, and puts a “nomination ticket” into the “hat”.  The more times a charity is nominated the more chance it has of being selected.  There will be 10 “tickets” drawn from the “hat” with winners announced on each weekday between 6 – 21 December.

We’re all volunteers and give our time for nothing but can do more with funds!

Ecclesiastical is encouraging everyone to use their social media channels to ask people to vote for their favourite cause to give them the best possible chance of winning – look for Church Matters <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ecclesiastical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Ecclesiastical</a> and use the following hashtags #bellringing #12days #movementforgood – spread the word!
