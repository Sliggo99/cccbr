The conference is open to all ringers. Please join us in Hilton, Derbyshire on 14/15 March 2020 – together we can make a difference!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ART Conference – Saturday 14 March</strong></span>

ART’s Conference agenda this year includes a great line up of speakers. In a break from tradition the key-note speaker is not a ringer. **Bonita Norris** is the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. Her talk – **_Mountains of the mind_** – speaks about the lessons she learned on this extraordinary journey as a very ordinary person - the marginal gains, the leaps of faith, the not giving up when failure seemed inevitable. These are all lessons in leadership that we recognise in our own ringing world. Bonita is joined by our other key-note speakers:

  * **Richard Grimmett **on **_Taking striking seriously_**
  * **Alison Hodge**and **Tony Crabtree** on **_What would TripAdvisor say about your tower?_**
  * **Mark Plater**(Senior Lecturer at Bishop Grosseteste University, Lincoln) on the **_Science and practice of motivation_**

A range of seminars will showcase innovative ideas and good practice from amongst the bell ringing community. Thanks to your feedback from the 2019 conference these include:

  * **Teaching with simulators**- Steve Farmer & Chris de Cordova
  * **Striking it right**- Colin Newman
  * **Starting a band from scratch**- Ginette Pardoe
  * **Learning the Ropes Festival of Ringing **- Nikki Thomas and Ruth Suggett
  * **The Social Media Toolkit**- Alison Everett, Deb Baker and Emily Ashton

We have also introduced a lunchtime **Teaching Forum** hosted by **Pip Penney** which will give you the chance to talk through any teaching issues you may have.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CCCBR Recruitment & Retention – Sunday 15 March</strong></span>

Continuing last year&apos;s successful partnership with the CCCBR, the second day of the conference is organised by the **_Volunteer and Leadership Workgroup_**. With a focus on recruitment and retention, they will look at how to look after your new ringers so that they blossom and enjoy their new hobby. Hearing from recent recruits, sharing ideas, initiatives and experience through grouped activities will provide you with ideas to take your recruitment and retention plans forward.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ART Awards</strong></span>

And don&apos;t forget the ART Awards Ceremony in the early evening. Help us celebrate and reward the great things that ringing teachers and leaders are doing to secure the future of ringing.
