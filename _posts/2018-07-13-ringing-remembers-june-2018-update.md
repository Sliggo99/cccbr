Fantastic news…  As at the date of writing, there are a total of 854 new recruits registered on the Ringing Remembers database at <a href="https://a100./register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://a100./register/</a> and continue to come in at a healthy rate.

We also know that ART have registered approximately 950 new learners and will be encouraging their learners to register with Ringing Remembers in the next edition of Tower Talk.

A HUGE thank you to everyone who has worked hard in recruiting and training these ringers, not only to join us in ringing for the Armistice Centenary, but hopefully beyond.  But let’s not rest on our laurels, there’s still time to recruit and teach.  Even if someone only gets as far as assisted backstrokes on the day they will have taken part and started something to which they can continue with afterwards.

Just a quick reminder, if you were contacted regarding someone wanting to learn to ring in your area, it would be extremely helpful if you could send us an update of how students that have been passed to you are progressing.  Have they been contacted?  Has a teacher been assigned, if so who? Have they started lessons yet? And even if they’ve decided it’s not for them after all.  That way we can really see how many new recruits will be ready to join us for ringing on Armistice Day.

**Posters & Leaflets**

Ringing Remembers posters and leaflets are making their way around the country, some have even flown to Australia and Ireland.  You can order a supply directly from <a href="https://a100./order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://a100./order/</a> and we’ll get them posted out as soon as possible.

**Media coverage**

Things certainly have been busy over the last few months.  Publicity has been hitting local media in Essex, Kent, Surrey, Derby, Leeds, Ireland, and we’ve featured in The Times and quite heavily in a couple of episodes of The Archers!

**Funding Available**

There is a small amount of funding available to support recruitment and training events for Ringing Remembers.  You can apply for this, in advance of your event, by completing the application form at <a href="https://a100./apply-for-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://a100./apply-for-funding/</a>

How’s your area been doing?  This heatmap shows the density of recruitment across the UK (apologies to our international friends, it only works on UK postcodes).  Do you need any help in your area?  If so, get in touch.

&nbsp;

Do keep me posted on your activities to recruit and train for Ringing Remembers.
