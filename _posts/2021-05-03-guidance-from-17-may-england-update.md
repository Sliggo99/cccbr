The draft guidance for the period from 17 May to 21 June, which enables ringers in England at least to plan for the next phase of lockdown release, has been updated. The previous version had given the impression that lateral flow tests would be required of all ringers coming back to ringing whereas that was not the intention. They do have value in certain circumstances, for instance where you have a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated ringers. Also there is clarification that the recommendation of limiting ringing to 45 minutes is just that - a recommendation for this transition period. It is not a statutory requirement, unlike the Rule of Six, which will be.

Please do read all of the two guidance documents as there is much more detail in them, and this is just a summary.
