Below is a poster from Big Ideas Co who are working with the CCCBR on the Ringing Remembers campaign.  Please circulate this to your towers and encourage them to put it up in church and village notice boards.  There will be a suite of images available to download soon to use on other material as well.

There will be some limited numbers of printed posters available, and a trifold information leaflet at the ART conference at the beginning of March and I would encourage someone from each Association to collect a set.  They will also be available at the CCCBR Annual Meeting in May, and again to download here website in due course.
