The Central Council voted to initiate a review of the Council with the outcome of concrete proposals next year, and is now looking for a number of ringers to volunteer for the **Action Group**.

Members will need to have time available in 2016 to work at getting a wide range of opinions and ideas from other ringers, ringing organisations and other stakeholders. If you are interested please [cccbr\_sc\_email address=&#8221;review@cccbr.tunbury.org&#8221; text=&#8221;email us&#8221;] **by 30th June** with a brief statement of why you are interested and what experience (ringing and outside of ringing) you might bring to this project.

Ruth Marshall (CC Representative for the Scottish Association of Change Ringers), Review Facilitator

For background, you may wish to read the [paper prepared for the Central Council meeting](http:///council/meetings/2016/2016-clarify-relationships-recommend-modernisation.pdf). It may also be helpful to read [Motion E and Motion F](http://www.methods.org.uk/archive/cca2016.htm) which were both passed at the meeting and help define the scope of review.
