The Young Ringers of Sussex have received a publicity boost thanks to the March edition of [Hurst Magazine.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54e2575ee4b066ba03085fac/t/5a9674d99140b7bd3c237822/1519809776314/HL36-Hurst-Life-magazine-March-web.pdf)

The article in Hurst Life, the community magazine for the village of Hurstpierpoint, features the 10 strong of band of Young Ringers that frequent the bells of Hurstpierpoint. It&apos;s jointly written by one of their band&apos;s active members, Josh Hutchinson.

It&apos;s an excellent portrayal of the wide variety of activities involved in ringing; from the National Youth Contest, quarter peals, to the weekly practice night&apos;s &#8216;cake break!&apos;

Well done Josh and Hurspierpoint band!
