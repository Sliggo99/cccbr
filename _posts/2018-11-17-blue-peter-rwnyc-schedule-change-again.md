CBBC have informed us that unfortunately the Blue Peter episode that will include the filming done at the Ringing World National Youth Contest in July will now be shown on **Thursday 10th January **at 5.30pm.  If they had tried to show it in the upcoming episode on 22nd November, they would have had to cut it short - so at least we will get the full piece by waiting until January!
