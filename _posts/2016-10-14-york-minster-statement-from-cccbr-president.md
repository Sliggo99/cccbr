As Council President, I have been involved with discussions with both Diocese and Minster staff, the former going back some time. The suspension of the Minster ringers came as a surprise however and I have been in further contact with the Minster today [13 October] and have offered the Council&apos;s assistance in seeking to resolve current problems. The requirement for recognised lead Roles in tower management is not unique to York and parishes across the country are being asked to regularise their appointment of volunteers in many spheres of activity. The key aim will be to restore ringing at the Minster as soon as is practicable.
