An article in health magazine “Breathe” outlines the health benefits of ringing, saying “_While it’s historically been associated in the West as a means of calling the faithful to worship, campanology has also become a sociable way of getting fit”_.  Shame about the picture.

The article is available to <a href="https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Breathe_issue_4_-_Campanology.pdf" target="_blank">download from here</a>.
