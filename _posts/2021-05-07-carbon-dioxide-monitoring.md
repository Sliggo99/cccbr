A paper explaining the rationale for CO2 monitoring in towers as a way of measuring the adequacy of ventilation has been published on the Covid guidance pages of the Council website <a href="/coronavirus/carbon-dioxide-monitoring-whilst-ringing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.Â  This research work has been done by Dr David Pouncey and reviewed by a number of other ringers with expertise in this area. Both David and Phil Barnes purchased CO2 meters before Christmas and did a limited amount of testing during Christmas ringing. We hope that more data can soon be accumulated.

It&apos;s important to note that this does not form part of the guidance for returning to ringing in any particular country. It is more so that we can understand the ventilation of our towers better and be prepared for any increases in virus in the future. Also, the version of the paper initiall published was updated on 9 May to include important safety information regarding undertaking testing by filling a ringing room with CO2.
