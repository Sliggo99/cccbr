VolitionRx Limited announced today that members of its senior management team and Board of Directors, including Chief Executive Officer, Cameron Reynolds, will ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Monday, March 13, 2017 at 4 p.m. U.S. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). This event recognises the Company&apos;s recent announcement of a CE mark for its Nu.Q<sup>TM</sup> Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test.

The bell-ringing at the NYSE will be preceded earlier that day by a bell ringing at Trinity Church Wall Street led by Volition&apos;s Chairman, Dr. Martin Faulkes. Dr. Faulkes, a keen ringer, donated and installed the 12 bells at Trinity Church Wall Street in 2006. This is the first 12-bell change-ringing installation in the United States, and therefore, offers a unique bell-ringing experience. At 10:00 am EDT on Monday, March 13th, Dr. Faulkes, along with 11 Volition shareholders, will attempt to ring a peal of Nu.Q<sup>TM</sup> Alliance Maximus which has been composed to celebrate Volition&apos;s first product, the Nu.Q<sup>TM</sup> Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test. Volition received CE Marking on the Nu.Q<sup>TM</sup> Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test in December 2016 and is currently marketing this novel blood test in Europe.

Speaking about the bell-ringing, Cameron Reynolds, CEO of Volition said: &#8220;We are very pleased to be at the NYSE at this very exciting time for Volition. We are coming to market with a diagnostic cancer test that we believe meets a pressing and immediate need in many European countries. Being able to offer healthcare systems a simple and easy to use blood test, which may be used to triage FIT positive populations for colorectal cancer, has the potential to make a significant and positive difference for their national colorectal cancer screening programs.&#8221;

The New York Stock Exchange will stream the closing bell ringing live on its website at <a href="http://www.nyse.com/bell" target="_blank">www.nyse.com/bell</a> at 4 pm EDT. A video of the event will also be archived on that page after the live stream.
