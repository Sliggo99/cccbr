Ringers will be aware of debate over the Whitechapel Foundry and may be interested in the campaign led by the East End Preservation Society.  They tell us they wish to have the foundry buildings listed and to explore ways of sympathetically repurposing the site.  They may be contacted via [spitalfieldslife.com](http://spitalfieldslife.com/2017/03/11/save-the-whitechapel-bell-foundry/)
