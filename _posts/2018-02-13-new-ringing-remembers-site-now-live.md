The <a href="/ringingremembers/?rf=32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armistice 100 Ringing Remembers website</a> is now open.

If you started learning at the beginning of November 2017, or were inspired by the campaign to return to ringing, please <a href="/ringingremembers/register/?rf=32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register here</a>.

The website also gives you some information and useful links (and [resources](https://a100./resources/)) regarding the Ringing Remembers campaign.
