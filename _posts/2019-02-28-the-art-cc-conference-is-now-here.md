It is at Worcester.  For those who can’t go, but would like to see it,  ART will be streaming a number of sessions live over the web, starting on Saturday morning and covering a great variety, including such things as Project Pickled Egg. They are also streaming the main speakers  on Sunday, which is about building a vision for the future of youth ringing and is hosted by the Central Council VL Workgroup.   You can see them via streaming on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ringingteachers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Facebook </strong></a>and the <a href="http://ringingteachers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ART homepage.</strong></a>
