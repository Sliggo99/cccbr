The Central Council is sad to learn that the Whitechapel Bell Foundry is to move from the premises in Whitechapel Road, where it has been for so many years. We send our very best wishes to the proprietors and staff at the foundry and wish them every success in their negotiations with potential purchasers for the business of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry Ltd, being a completely separate issue from the sale of the premises.
