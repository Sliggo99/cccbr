The PR Committee thought that you would want to look out for this in Sunday’s Telegraph (Jan 29<sup>th</sup>).  Unless there is other breaking news, there should be a two-page feature on Julie and the amazing bell ringing campaign to save lives, in which many of you have been involved, and which has raised over £7m to date.  The press release, with which we approached the National press in the first instance, is available on the [Press Releases](/press-releases/) page.  St Paul’s will be ringing for the campaign around 2pm on Sunday 22nd, and its website will also reference the event.  In due course a recording of the event will be made accessible - we hope, if all goes well, via Bells on Sunday.
