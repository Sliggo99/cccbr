_<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Leading church insurer Ecclesiastical is launching a campaign to raise awareness of the contribution of churches to the local community, beyond their religious duties alone. The sound of church bells is synonymous with a feeling of community spirit and togetherness, so the campaign would like to include bell ringing in its plans, to remind the public of the role that churches play in their local area.
