The Church of England has partnered with Marie Curie on 23<sup>rd</sup> March 2021 to mark the first anniversary of the first lockdown in the UK with a national day of reflection to reflect on our collective loss due to Covid-19, support those who have been bereaved, and hope for a brighter future.

Bellringers have been invited by the Church to participate in this day by marking the end of the one minute silent reflection at 12 noon by tolling a bell at 12:01.  There are other ways to get involved on the day detailed on the Marie Curie website at <https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/get-involved/day-of-reflection>

An event has been set up on Bellboard if you wish to associate any ringing with this day at <https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/event.php?id=13572>
