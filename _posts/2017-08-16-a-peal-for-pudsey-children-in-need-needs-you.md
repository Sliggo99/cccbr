<span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">The Central Council Public Relations Committee has been working with </span>the BBC’s Children In Need campaign for 2017, collaborating on an idea which should both raise national awareness of bell ringing, as well as money for a great cause! </span>

<span style="margin: 0px; color: black; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">We are hoping that many groups of bellringers will get </span><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">themselves </span>sponsored to ring bells to raise money for Children In Need<span style="color: #000000;">,</span> and this could be on tower bells, hand bells, or mini-rings. Anything from rounds and call changes, touches, extents, quarter peals, peals, <span style="color: #000000;">- </span>any sort of ringing that you would like to do. If you can ring a Pudsey Method, then even better, though it is not obligatory! <span style="color: #000000;">(Pudsey is the name of the bear mascot of Children in Need). </span>There is to be a special page created on <span style="color: #000000;">the </span>BT MyDonate website for ringers to show everyone what they have done and how much money they have raised, and an event on Bellboard to link to your performance. <span style="color: #000000;">In this way we will be able to demonstrate, hopefully on the final TV show, what bellringers as a whole have done to support the cause.</span></span>

<span style="margin: 0px; color: black; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The above  logo has been produced, and is intended to be used for promotional material for any ringing activities associated with the campaign. We hope that it will gets lots of use and help to raise the profile of bellringing in a very positive way.</span>

<span style="margin: 0px; color: black; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The campaign runs from October 5th to November 17th (which is Children In Need night) </span><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000000;">and</span> you can do your sponsored ringing any time between those dates<span style="color: #000000;">, - </span>more than once if you wish! There are still some further details of other proposed activities to be worked out, and we will keep you informed <span style="color: #000000;">when we know more</span>.</span>
