After an interview in December with Caroline Levy-Cooper at Cowden, and myself, BBC Radio Kent is now following up and we were featured again this morning with a live interview with myself.  Live fir another 29 days you can listen to it about 35 mins in for 8 mins.  Caroline tells Jo Burn about Harold Ladd who died Dec 2017, and I speak to Mike Ziolek - who we might need to get back into ringing! Sorry about all my ‘ums’!  Too early in the morning for me clearly!
