The database is split into several sections:

**Organisation.** This defines the structure of the Central Council (Representative and Affiliated Societies, Committees) and the Roles involved (Officers of Council, Committee Membership). It has two distinct sets of data:

  * [Organisation](http:///database/help/organisation/)
  * [Roles](http:///database/help/roles/)

**Membership.** This defines the membership of council, the societies represented any offices held, and has three distinct sets of data:

  * [People](http:///database/help/people/)
  * [Members](http:///database/help/members/)
  * [Role Assignment](http:///database/help/role-assignment/)

**Peal Records.**

  * [Record Peals](http:///database/help/record-peals/)

**Biographies/Prolific Peals.**

  * [Biographies and Prolific Peal Ringers](http:///database/help/biographies/)

To access each section you must have the &#8216;CCCBR Read Organisation Data&apos;, &#8216;CCCBR Read Members Data&apos; , &#8216;CCCBR Read Peals Data&apos; or &#8216;CCCBR Read Biographies Data&apos; capability respectively. To amend data you must also have the corresponding Update capability.

Clicking on the link from the main database page will take you to a display of all _current_ records. Click on the ID for a record to display the full content (if you have update access you will be able to amend the data, or click the NEW ITEM button to create a new record). CANCEL should always take you back to the page you came from (without making any changes if you have Update access).

If you do have update access, the Update page will give you options to UPDATE the record (or ADD if inserting a new one). Once UPDATE has been clicked you will see the record as amended. Click on the OK button to return to the display page.

On the Update page, fields which are editable have a white background - those which which are locked have a grey background.

Note that data is never deleted - even though you may be presented with a REMOVE button. Instead the record is hidden from view and could be restored by a database administrator. Also note that all changes to the data are logged for diagnostic and recovery purposes.

Further details will be displayed on the Help page for each set of data. And for detailed information refer to the documentation available in the GitHub repository.
