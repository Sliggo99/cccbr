                As restrictions to ringing continue for some time yet, the association of Ringing Teachers (ART) and the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers (CCCBR) have joined forces to bring a series of activities, teaching, and support ways in which we can help ringers and bands stay together and then recover. For example, the production of a Survival and Recovery Toolbox from which ringers, bands and even ringing societies can pick the tools that will best help them keep going until ringing can resume and tailor them to local needs. The toolbox will give access to training, a variety of new (and old) ideas and the opportunity to learn from what others have done or are thinking of doing. The toolkit, whilst hosted by ART is very much a joint initiative with resources being developed together.

          <p>
            We are also issuing a regular joint newsletter giving updates, stories, and information fresh off the press.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The toolkit and newsletters can be accessed via&nbsp;<a href="https://ringingteachers.org/survival-and-recovery-toolbox">https://ringingteachers.org/survival-and-recovery-toolbox</a>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Council Executive and ART Management Committee are thinking about recovery strategies at a more fundamental level as well. If you have any ideas or would like to help in any aspect of this – building, delivery or engagement – then please get in contact with us. Working together is the best way of building a positive future for ringing.&nbsp;

            <strong>Recovery Champions</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To coordinate the flow of ideas and information, we are coordinating a network of&nbsp;<strong>Recovery Champions</strong>&nbsp;across the country who will focus on recovery planning within the local area. They won’t necessarily be the people doing all the work or dealing with mailing lists; but they will be in the best position to know how that could work in their local area.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Please consider becoming a Recovery Champion if you are planning activity in your local area. Networking with others will give you ideas, help and support – you don&apos;t have to do it all yourself. Each Association has been asked to nominate people who will be good Champions, however particularly for the larger ringing societies Champions will work best at District level or even more local than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no limit to the number of Champions an Association can have.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Recovery Champions will have access to a range of tools and contacts to help them meet the needs of their local area. It’s all free and available to be shared with individual Tower Captains, churches and ringers.
          </p>

            If you think this initiative will be helpful to you and ringers, or you’d like to find out more, please contact Annie Hall who is coordinating the Recovery Champions at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:annie.hall@sky.com">annie.hall@sky.com</a>
