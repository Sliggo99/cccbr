            The Central Council is often asked by the Media and others for images of bells, bellringing, churches and so on for news articles, magazines and websites.Â  We are aiming to build a library of suitable, contemporary images covering a range of scenes and scenarios. The images will then be made available in a gallery for anyone to access and use, therefore important to follow the guidelines set out on the upload <a href="/competition/upload">page</a>, which accepts that these pictures will be used by others for the benefit of ringing. The Central Council will not profit from the use of submitted images. To upload a photo please click <a href="/competition/upload">here</a>.
