Without doubt, one of the major successes for bellringing during 2018 was the Ringing Remembers recruitment campaign, aimed at recruiting 1,400 new ringers in memory of the 1,400 ringers who died during World War I, in this Armistice centenary year.

It seemed that this project captured the imagination of the national press, and an official launch was made on 11th November 2017 from Eddington, a tower that had lost its entire band during the war.

The UK Government encouraged open ringing at 12.30 on 11th November 2018 to coincide with the Nation’s Thank you, a 10,000 strong march past the Cenotaph in London. By the end of the campaign, some 3,332 people had registered and at last count 2,804 of those are known to have taken part in commemorative ringing during the day.
