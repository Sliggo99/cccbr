# Days related to Easter

Easter is a ‘moveable feast’, whose date varies. The Western church uses the date established by the First Council of Nicaea, which is the first Sunday after the (Paschal) full moon following the northern hemisphere’s (ecclesiastical) vernal equinox. As a result the date of Easter varies between March 22 and April 25. See the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://almanac.oremus.org/easter/bradley.html" target="_blank">Easter Date Calculator</a>.
