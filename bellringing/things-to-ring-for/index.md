            Bells can do much more than announce church services. Ringing for public events is an excellent way to join in with community celebration, and helps to connect ringers with the general public. There are many opportunities – current events, anniversaries of historic events, and special days each year – secular as well as religious – as well as local events and anniversaries that you could mark with special ringing.

            Try to find out about things early enough to plan your ringing, and publicise it. An article about ringing for public events published in <em>The Ringing World</em> is available <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ringing-for-public-events.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <strong>Major Ringing Events</strong><br />The Council sometimes asks for widespread ringing, coordinated across the country (or world for events of international significance) for events that either have such a high profile that the public will expect ringing, or for which the church or government has requested widespread ringing.&nbsp; In both cases a coordinated effort, and engagement with both national and local media, can achieve more impact on the public consciousness than purely local initiatives.
          </p>

            Major ringing events are normally announced well ahead so you can plan in advance.&nbsp; But occasionally external requests for ringing (from church or government) may come at much shorter notice.&nbsp; If an event is likely to be controversial (for example the centenary of the 1914 war) the Council consults with ringers before recommending how it should be commemorated.

            <strong>Operation London Bridge<br /></strong>Ringing for the death of a monarch is thankfully not something we have to worry about very often.&nbsp; There are, however, specific plans and protocols in place for such an occasion.&nbsp; There is more information in the Guidance Note below.
